Gringer; You can also try out the International Massage Centre on Al-Kinana Street. Separate entrances for men and women. They are from Kerala (India) and very good. I personally avail of the facility quite often. There is also a doctor at the Centre whom you can consult for any complaints. A one-hour full body massage is QRs. 100/-. Their telephone number is 4421343.

Q1_R10_C5
ive seen a lot of MASSAGE PARLOR(all over d city i guess)..and tried d FILIPINO MASSAGE CENTER and terramax was right they were gud and d service was excellent..but m just curious though..haven't seen any facial center or facial spa here..or whatever u may call it.. have u?...
Q1_R10_C6
good facial centres/spas;try marriott or ritz; they have a lovely spa; but expensive. a new place opened up opp city centre; its called bio something.they too specialise in the same stuff.again expensive. lady siam centre near toys r us; alsadd area; is good too.they specialise in thai massages and stuff and their facial is really nice and soothing. had it long time back; but communiacting with them is difficult as they speak only thai and broken english. massage; you can try chinese reflexology massage at ramada; that good too; also the kottakal massage centre in muntaza area; cheap and good for body pains and stuff.both are priced at aprox 100qrs. almost all saloons do facials and some have real extensive range of facials.u need to try out the places to get a feel of it. i just saw your profile; you sound so much like me; except the coke and margarita part.
