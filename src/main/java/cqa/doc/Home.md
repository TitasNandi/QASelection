QARank is a freely available open source tool for Answer Selection and Ranking in Community Question Answering sites. The tool has been trained and tested on the SemEval 2016 Task 3 data. Though the tool has been applied on CQA sites' data until now, it can easily be used for feature extraction and answer quality detection on data available from other sources as well. 
The system when tested on the original test data of SemEval 2016 for subtask A gives results which are at par with the best systems which participated in this task. The MAP score on the original test data is 78.42. 
The tool takes a feature based approach for good answer selection and ranking. The tool combines various String Similarity, word embedding, dialogue identification, topic modeling and numerous domain specific features to build a robust Question Answering Model. The software components, the training data and all data used for feature generation are distributed under permissive licenses, thus this ranker tool can be used in academic and commercial settings without restrictions or fees.
