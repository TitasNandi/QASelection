Q318_R6_C9 Good
well maybe if there wasn't 1 billion of you guys trying to take the same job from those few companies. Yet the new generation is also going crazy enrolling in IT degrees... How many IT jobs you think there are in this place? Unix and Linux are jobs for men in here.. Yes believe me; certain jobs are dedicated for each gender... an IT company that needs a Unix admin; that is 99.99% male dominated department would NEVER hire a woman. Sorry to burst the bubble; reality is bitter Good luck try harder.

Wish u all the best.

Dear and beloved brother in Islam; it is not the concept of banking per say which is forbidden in Islam; but it is the concept and dealings of ‘riba’ which forms the very back-bone of conventional interest-based banks; which is absolutely forbidden in Islam by Allah and His Messenger (saws). The Islamic Banks or Islamic Financial Institutions are all based on Shariah-compliant interest-free dealings; and it would be absolutely permissible for a believer to seek employment in an Islamic Bank; if he wishes to do so. Islamic way of banking: Most people are so used to the conventional interest-based banking system; that in their ignorance of the laws of Shariah-compliant Islamic Economics they may at times accuse the Islamic Financial Institutions of dealing in interest or ‘riba’ with just a different name. A simple example can be cited to make the concept of ‘haraam’ and ‘halaal’ clearer. If one marries a woman and satisfies his pleasure; it is considered ‘halaal’ and .....

Dear people in Islam thankyou every one of you for your valuable answers. i did a little research on this topic and i came to know that; no matter whatever the banks are. if their capital has riba involved in it and if the banks are dealing with riba ; then the business is haram. it depends on what they are dealing with. for example - all ''Q'' companies are dealing and doing business with some product so their business is halal but when some company does liquor and riba and other haram things involved in it ; then it becomes haram. i also found this that: in olden days the trade used to take place between products like rice for wheat; or rice for milk or rice for sugar or other dealings which is halal; then came currency : wheat for dirhams; dirhams for rice which still is halal but when the currency came in like 1 kg of good quality gold for 3 kg of bad quality gold and people started this thing and started to cheat in this currency to currency to gold to gold ; or good quality wheat.....

Q323_R7_C5 Bad
The players decide who goes first; perhaps via ip dip; (American: Eeny; meeny; miny; moe) or a variant; then the jacks are scattered loosely into the play area. The players take it in turn to bounce the ball off the surface; then pick up jacks; then catch the ball before it bounces twice. There are variants on this procedure. Sometimes the ball is thrown into the air rather than bounced. Sometimes it is bounced against a wall or target; if that is in the vicinity of play. Sometimes no bounce is allowed at all. In some variants; the players must pick up as many jacks as possible in each turn. Perhaps more commonly; the number of jacks to be picked up is pre-ordained and sequential: at first you must pick up one (onesies); next two (twosies); and so on. In most versions of the game; only one hand may be used. To simplify play; both may be used; to make it harder; or to impose a handicap; a player might be required to use their off-hand (eg; the left if right-handed). http://en.wikipedia......

I am in the process of shifting between two apartments from two different landlords. This means I'll need to terminate the kahramaa contract for the old apartment and start a new one; is this something you can do in a single step process? If you have done this before; what is the best way of doing it?
Q324_R5_C1 Good
find kahrama office service depending on you area .. you need to cancel the first contract and the initiate new one .. not two birds in one shot .. cancellation procedures : 1- take photo of the meter reading of electrisity and water both .. 2-fill up the form of cancellation 3- copies of your identity cards 4-copy of your tenancy contract 5-copy of gurantee slip (2000)QR then they will calculate your balance and issue check QNB or you have to pay in case your previous payments exceeds the limit of 2000 QR advanced; next step initiate new account ... same procedure when you applied first time ... goodluck :))

What will be the effect in the medium term (five to ten years) of continued property development on prices? 4. Are there reliable data on how the expatriate population will grow over the next five to ten years? Do you know whether there will be a growth in single people versus families; or vice versa. How will this affect demand for flats versus villas? 5. Is the current property boom caused by real demand; or by an increase in liquidity in Qatar because of high crude prices? 6. What is the proposed lifespan for the development? Is this lifespan supported by structural engineers reports? 7. If buying a property before completion; is it likely that it w.....
Q324_R21_C3 Good
Ngourlay makes some very good points that any person thinking of investing should seriously consider. I've been looking into the number of people coming to Qatar and the supply of property for some time. What is interesting is that demand is likely to continue to outstrip supply for the next 4-5 years. After this point; the Pearl; Lusail and other developments will come fully on stream and then I suspect property prices will come down as there will be enough supply. But on the other hand; Qatar is similar to how Dubai was in the mid 1990s. The potential is really impressive in the long term so real estate in Qatar is a good investment. As far as Lusail goes - I've consistently heard that it is running behind schedule and will not be completed on time. The first new development which will be ready seems to be the Zig Zag towers in June/July. They still have a couple of apartments left near the top I hear so it might be a better investment than Lusail given delays etc.....
Q324_R21_C4 Good
You should not compare it to Dubai since prices in dubai when they statred selling 5 years ago were low and there was a big potential for buying; in Doha; a 2 bed appartment is selling for the same price as in dubai now; so even though there will be some upward potential; i dont think its enough to take the risk second; when i first came here in january i was interested in buying and i went to see the buildings with al sabban towers and they said that out of three towers they still have one to be sold; 6 months later they still had few appartment in that same tower; and now they are also selling the other two which were still not sold; in dubai; a compound of 6000 villa was sold in three days. third; between the pearl and lusail and waab cilty finishing all together; i dont think that doha is ready to fill all these empty appartments with such an inflation and people are starting to lok for other alternatives than doha I always tell the truth; even when I lie
Q324_R21_C5 Good
I have brought on the zig Zag about 7 months ago; and it has gone up so say 300;000 ryals. Not bad I hear you say but its paper money till you sell it; and I don't yet see an emerging sales market. Personally I am torn now; sell when the towers are finished take a quick profit OR Rent and hold on to it long term. Right now I am looking at the former; if i can make even 200;000 I am happy as that is more than the bank would have given me. We shall see; I would recommend zig zag purely because it will be finished first; the Pearl looks good long term and will be desirable. If al Wabb is cheap then great; get in. Loisil well that really is a lonnnnng way off; at least 5 years in my opinion before it would be worth it. but as a long term bet it could be good and might actually be a better bet than the Pearl as I think that NOW its over priced. Some friends got in when prices were lower; but now is is crazy money and there will be A LOT of towers down there.

Q324_R21_C7 Bad
"Dear aviduser; actually the same question as already posted by navi ...""what is the situation for residence permit?"" are you getting it straight after the purchasing property or need to wait until it's completion; or even something else. How is the law and rules work here? You advise will be very valid for me; since I'm too new for this place. Congrats; for your purchase but now I'm totally confused whether it's worthy to look for Lusail or not? All these buildings won't be finished before 2010;so no return from any of the investment upon that time; which makes bank loan too heavy for me. Any approximate expectation on rental prices for ZigZag? What is the actual prices now for apartments in these towers since you already planning to sell them soon? Thanks."
Q324_R21_C8 Good
"So you hold both. But it means that you don't need exit permits any more. Then if you quit your job you can stay move job do whatever. This all sounds great I know but I am thinking that if you tell an employer you don't need to be sponsored they may not hire you as they have less control over you. In my case getting rid of the Exit permit thing is a big bonus. Zig Zag two beds are up now for about 1.9 million they were 1.6 Rental returns well I don't know; compared to Beverly Hills tower where the average is 18K I am hoping for 14-16K Hopefully. Loisil is so long away the financing in this country does not make any sense. Dubai was mentioned earlier; what people fail to mention with that ""boom"" is flats were offered with very low down payments and then nothing until completion. This meant people with enough cash could secure hundreds of apartments each they then sold the options on these flats on for a little profit and on the cycle went; with only the person holding the flat at the c....."

Did you pay a security deposit when you moved in? That will be forfeited which is no big deal. But since you have issued cheques that will now be bouncing you will have a criminal record in the GCC.

It all depends on your lifestyle and what you are coming for. You can blow off 9000Qr in a week; a month; or be able to save up to 4000 QR out of it per month. You can rent a car for around 1600-1800 QR per month; but I would recommend buying a second hand car or a brand new one if you plan to stay here for 3-4 years; and you can pay around 750-1000QR per month and own the car. For food and personal expenses; 2000-3000QR is what you need so you will end up having 1000QR to shop with ; and 4000QR to save! Email me if you need more info; use my profile to email me. Cheers!

For Mechanical Engineer; you can get atleast Grade 4; for Grade 4 Minimum Basic is QR 12000/- and the Maximum is QR 14000/- Apart from basic; you'll get 9% Fix Basic OT and Housing Allowance will be QR 4000/-; if you are married and bring your family here. If you are not married it will be QR 2500/- But I suggest ask for family status; if u r even single now. So that in future if u get married you can get QR 4000 as Housing Allowance.

For a Mechanical Engineer will be around QAR 26;000. And you also get to live in a world-class peaceful community; Also known as the Al Khor Community; with families of Qatargas' and Rasgas' Employees. All the benefits in RasGas are also provided in QatarGas; but RasGas has a bit more higher salary and you get monthly trips to Sealine beach resort for Quad-biking and Jet skiing; and also get PSP's; expensive mobile phones etc. Hope you get a good job and hope i've .....

Q326_R34_C1 PotentiallyUseful
You should ask yourself how much you will need to live a decent life. That would require some research on the cost of living in Qatar. Once you've done that you should add an amount you are planning to save. Then you can demand that amount and if they don't accept it you shouldn't bother to come here.

One of the major dilemma a prospective employee faces is his / her salary requirement. During the interview process; an applicant realise how good he / she was in answering questions being raised. An applicant should be able to impress HR that he is not only the best candidate but the only suitable candidate for the job. If you are able to impress HR then you can demand. How much you are worth? It all depends on YOU. Every company has a salary scale (minimum - maximum) for each and every job however; if you are worth more; demand. Chances are; you can get it; depending on YOU.
Q326_R34_C5 Bad
"Thanks for all the replies. Already done some research on the cost of living in Qatar. My lifestyle will not be fancy just simple ""work - home"" and then weekend groceries.

Like it should be basic of 10K then free accommodation and transport allowance?? Pls. share your idea. Thanks"

Q326_R34_C7 PotentiallyUseful
No you should not but it should normally come after the probationary period and should be requested by your manager. So rather than speaking to HR; may be you should ask your manager about it (if you are in contact with him/her).

Salam; I am mechanical Eng. 15 years experience; i got a job for Rasgas co. direct hire; I am married and i have 2 kids; 5 & 3 years old.my life style is average . is 8.000 QR enaugh as a basic salary ? if you know; please tell me what another benefits ? is it good to join Rasgas initially on single status for 6 months; then change to family status? please help me urgently.
Q326_R90_C1 Good
If the salary includes other benefits; such as accommodation & transportation; then I think that would be enough...initially. Try to scout among your peers during your probationary period and request from there if there is such a need to ask for an increment and/or is it really feasible to bring your family here. Hope it would be of help pal.
Q326_R90_C2 Good
its a good package. 8000 base and a good 3-4k extra for housing and all that. its pretty decent if you ask me. then again with 8000 you will have to cringe. with a 2 children family. you gotta... push it
Q326_R90_C3 Good
Depends on your position. 8;000 QR is quite less for an engineer. Most of Oil/Gas companies in Qatar gives up to 6 months probation periods; it depends upon your performance; maybe for only 3 months; you will get hired already as regular employee. After that; then you can bring your family in Qatar. For the other benefits; I have no idea; but probably its good because Rasgas is a big company. O.T.. When did you get the interview in Rasgas? I am waiting also.
Q326_R90_C4 Good
for your profession; that is too low. mechanical engineer cost more than that. even if there would be additional housing or transpo cost; still that would be too low. Remember; its RasGas that ur going to work.
Q326_R90_C5 PotentiallyUseful
the said salary (basic) is okay other benefit may over come the basic salary so just calculate.
Q326_R90_C6 Good
I agree with the answer at the top. QR8k is much to small with 15 years of experience for engineer is Rasgas. If other stuff such as accomodation and schools are provided than you will do just fine.

VNINOH And everyone else - RASGAS Co. First up; congrats on the offer mate; a quick word; RASGAS is a very good company and standards of work and culture are pretty nice... Now coming to your question... The salary that they offer you with QR 8K Basic (having 15yrs of experience) is a TOTAL CRAP...HEAR ME MY FRIEND With that kinda experience I would say a BARE MINIMUM SALARY OF 15000 QR...at a Company like Rasgas...and this my friend is purely purely Basic; cos they normall provide Housing at their Al-Khor Community for Employees and life in there is quite nice; Schooling is covered for your children; yearly air tickets for you and family; MEdical Insurance for you and members of your family; and other such extra perks and yearly bonuses and appraisals are all not included... QR 15000K is a Bare minimum; by the way having said this; whats the position...but irrespective of that; QR 8000 is just a total waste; and DO NOT ACCEPT IT! I'm not being racist here; but for other Nationalities .....

Hi I am an engineer having 16 yrs experience recently came to qatar. 8 K Basic is really very very bad salary; according to me don't accept it.

Just refuse the offer and wait for good one!!

Each employee is entitled to a free return air ticket within QR network for herself/himself; and her/his family (depending on one's grade). Which class they are entitled to is also dependent on the grade. They are also entitled to purchase discounted tickets; but that is on sub-load basis meaning the the seats are not confirmed and one could be bumped out in the last moment in case flights are full. It's an industry practice.
Q328_R23_C5 Bad

If yes I have another question: In my contract I have this weird clause about housing saying that I have either 3.500qt housing allowance or an housing offred by the company and this is SOLILY a decision from QR which means that if they don't provide housing I will spend 20% of my salary on housing (apparentely I will need 10k to have a descent flat) what do you think? who.am.i plz keep in touch would be nice if you're looking for friends with same interests.

On the contract; you will find everything you need to know about your salary and benefits so I'm wondering why you are so confused. I don't recommend you to take the housing allowance hence accept the accommodation that QA will provide for you. If you are a bachelor; you don't need to spend 10K for a flat. I don't get most of your point. Sorry. cheers; paul

Or maybe we feel we will not be able to bear the pressure and commitment that may come once we take that path of speaking out against a wrong. The solution then is to first overcome these fears and know that by our keeping quiet not only will a wrong doer get off Scott free and a crime go unpunished; but we may very well find ourselves in the place of the victim next; with no one to speak for us!

I don't think the problem is with HMC as far utilising the medical city building is concerned; but i don't know the details.

Q329_R75_C10 Good
Jackmphan They are know thinking about including the single status in the contract. I am just putting everything into picture; HMC hired many nurses in last 2 years. When they came they were offered either housing or housing allowance. Almost all took housing allowance; then they called their families on visit visa; once their husbands found a job in qatar; they want to forfeit housing allowance and instead they want a house from HMC. This means thousands of units and this is not an easy job and plus estimate the rent. By and large HMC has been favourable to its employs; i know many hospitals in gulf do not allow females to bring their families. Plus not so long ago; no organization in qatar was even giving housing allowance to females; they either get single accomodation or nothing at all.

Q331_R11
can someone fill me in on the story with palm tree island?
Q331_R11_C1 Good
Nice beautiful; if a bit unkept; manmade Island which served quite rightly to provide enterteinment to the desperate families who coldn´t afford to pay or couldn´t get into an expensive healthclub. Once day; someone very clever decides to destroy it; leaving instead a piece of sand with one tree in the middle. Rumours have been circulating about the next project that will take its place: a fountain; an acuatic IKEA; a swim-thru McDonals; the tallest building ever made; etc...but so far; nothing has happened and most probably nothing will ever replace that little oasis of entertainment in a city where there is absolutely nothing to do.
Q331_R11_C2 Good
Once upon a time it was a small island with a little fun fair and some entertainment for faimlies. Than from one day to the other everything just disappeared; except one single tree. Rumours say that it was for the safety of the Doha Asian Games. But so far nothing is there; and I don't know if there will be ever again...
Q331_R11_C3 Good
Two years ago; when I came to this country...someone lured me to go this this island one weekend. It costs only 20riyals (to and from the island; includes the entrance fee; i suppose)drow boat ride. There you can relax in a lounger under the shade of the trees; watching the others swin; play volleyball or the children play in the sand. And since the beach side faces to the sea...you'll feel like you're in a tropical island away from QATAR (my opinion). waiters are ready to take your food order. Read a book while you smoke sheesha. If you get hungry; there was a seafood restaurant for you to dine in... It was my small heaven; my recluse whenever I feel homesick; work-stressed or just plain lazy to do anything... NOW...IT'S JUST AN EMPTY ISLAND...and the tree there is not even a PALM TREE? :-( What you are is what you have been; and what you will be is what you do now. - Buddha

"I think it was a great loss to Doha when they demolished that Island. It was such a wonderful place to be in. They also did not provide any information to the public about the reason behind this decision. I guess they could have easly said: ""because qatarisun & her/his partner have split up"" :-) But butterfly; there are still many places to go to here & many things to do in Doha.

Q331_R11_C7 Bad
"""there are still many places to go to here & many things to do in Doha"" Of course there are; the parks and the malls and if you can spend the money; the expensive hotel´s beach clubs.

Q331_R11_C8 PotentiallyUseful
this is Air Supply/non-westerner/The Che....(banned 14 times so far) What's wrong with parks; malls and driving away from Doha? Actually if you chose not to spend much money in these places; it is easy to do it (for people with limited income)(I agree they don't have much nice free beaches in Doha) And if you want to spend money; what's wrong in going to fancy clubs & hotels? Isn't all this/the above the facts about a simple city life? To have these varieties? How about the lovely Souqs with their wonderful cafes? You will enjoy them so much & spend very little. Who wants noisy nightclubs; they are available. Who want a quiet glass of wine; it's available (Golf Club for example); who wants a park; an old Souq; Cafes; Malls; Shops; far beeches; exclusive beeches...all available. Damn! Why did they demolish the Palm Island! It used to be my favorite place!
Q331_R11_C9 Good
For someone like me (who grew up in a place where you just cross the road from your house and you reach the beach); one whole day or afternoon in Palm Tree Island makes me feel I'm back home.

This happened in apartments on LSU's campus. It had nothing to do with racism. Unfortunately for these two young men the police believe it was a home invasion.

So please don't go crying racism. This is a terrible thing that has happened. Pray for the victims and their families.

In my North American university they had the system of averaging out the grades. (It is a very complicated system; you cannot understand it and neither did I). So what happened was that I was failing; and in order to pass I needed to put all the other nerds in the course to sleep. But those jerks would study all day and never sleep and I was very much worried about the health effects on them for not sleeping. In the end I told my professor of the Pressure on those students; so he gave all of them A Grades and me got B grade. Here is what happened in the exam. After one hour had passed in the exam; he told us if anyone of you wants to leave; he can leave and he will get a B. So I happily left. I was the only one to leave. For the rest who stayed he gave all of them A for believing in themselves.

western engineers with Master degree are getting more than that here as basic + other benefits. in my opinion the above offer can be accepted if they provide u a furnished accommodation otherwise half of ur salary (aprox.) will go for rent and the other half will be spent on the daily expenses & u will end up saving nothing.

a normal treatment (60mts) at ritz will cost you between 500 to 1K..just try Six senses websites..very informative..
Q333_R27_C6 Good
Nah; I don't think it's worth it. Four Seasons is cheaper and just as good as Spa Chakra. Visit www.qatarhappening.com
Q333_R27_C7 Good
i actually had a treatment at the six senses spa; and it was fantastic! i would definitely recommend it. but of course; it would depend on what you value more...the price or the value. what the spa in ritz offer is different from four seasons and chakra. from what i know; the spa in ritz is managed by six senses; and the outlook is traditional; but still luxurious. six senses's products are really good; and their service is also great. if you have time (and money); definitely try all of them...its best to find one that suits you
Q333_R27_C8 Good
I always go to the Marriott; they are very good. the Ritz Carleton and Al Sharq are good too. I've heard that the four season is excellent but expensive.

Q333_R27_C10 Bad
ah...this is because they designed it to be in tradtitional qatari architecture. i actually think its very clean and stylish~ my opinion. they recently got a vietnamese therapist and she is now giving vietnamese massage with cuppings~ very interesting treatment!

Hello; I am thinking of buying a new Suzuki Vitara (around QAR 88k for the full option model); but I have no idea of the resale value of Suzuki&#39;s in Qatar. Can anyone help? Is this a good deal? I was also considering a Rav4; but not sure it&#39;s worth the extra money? Thanks
Q333_R34_C1 Good
If you are willing to buy a new Suzuki for 88k; I would suggest you go for a Prado which is around 105k and has a much better resale value.
Q333_R34_C2 Good
105k is for teh most basic model; not for full option. Full option is around 135k. I would still go for a basic prado against a full option vitara.
Q333_R34_C3 Good

Q333_R34_C5 Good
I bought a grand vitara last year XL7 it was for a good price. but i really regretted; the service of teyseer is the worst I've ever experienced: lousy; unhelpful service staff with disgusting facilities. I took me two visits to the service center before i give up and started taking it to other oil changing shops . besides; the car has many manufacturing defects (according to a friend he is still facing them in his new model): CD player; brake system... At the time when I bought it it was the only car with 7 seaters with a very reasonable price (67000); but finally It would have been better for me if i bought a pajero or a pathfinder. On the top of all that the resale value of the suzuki is not so encouraging.
Q333_R34_C6 Bad

Q333_R34_C7 Good
Dear Hames If you are worried about the resale value of the grand Vitara I have one (a 2008 model)which I could sell you for a good price abour 25% off the price you were quoted. It has a 4 cylinder 2 L engine; fully automatic; white colour with black interior and has a KM reading of only 7;000 Km. The car is like new.

Q333_R49_C4 Good

Q333_R49_C6 Good
Jeans from a regular shop in Villagio costs minimum Qar100.00 plus. Women's blouses range from Qar60.00 and much more. Clothes are expensive here; and the quality is not really that well; unless you buy from a signature shop.
Q333_R49_C7 Good
I think clothes prices are higher in UK than here..but it's always wiser to buy clothes during Sale season as u can really get good deals during those times..
Q333_R49_C8 PotentiallyUseful
When the exchange rate was 7 clothes were the same if not cheaper than in the UK. But now the rate has dropped to nearly 5 clothes are definitely more expensive here.
Q333_R49_C9 Good
It depends on the brand. As a general rule most UK brands (such as BHS; Next; M&S; H&M) are priced at an exchange rate of QR7 to £1. As the current rate is closer to QR5 to £1 clothes will be cheaper in the UK. On top of this retailers are discounting heavily in the UK because of the recession. If you look at some French or Spanish brands (Zara) they are cheaper in Doha.
Q333_R49_C10 PotentiallyUseful
I agree that now the exchange rate is so low then clothes are deifnitely cheaper back in UK especially with the great sales that are on there at the moment. Unless you buy from a recognised brand here the quality is not very good; so my is advice take a holiday back in uk and fill your suitcase with all the bargains there!!

So it is evident that they will not give me NOC and i will be banned for 2 yrs. My husband is working here in Qatar. But his salary is too low to apply for a family resident visa.

There is no salary specification for visit visa; what matter most is NOC from your company and the profession on your RP must not be labour. Go to immigration or submit the following through your company PRO to immigration. NOC letter from your sponsor. Salary Pay Slip RP( The profession must not be labour) your wife and daughter passport Marriage certificate( attested by your embassy) You pay 200riya with this document.(you pay this with your card when you want submit) The visa will be one month visit visa but it can be extended to 6months with payment of 200riya every month provided your wife and child pass the medical test within the first month. Note- TO CHANGE YOUR FAMILY VISIT VISA TO FAMILY RESIDENCE VISA YOU MUST HAVE A SALARY OF 10;000 RIYA. best of luck.

Q336_R37
Has anyone actually gone to a doctor here for sleeping pills and recieved them? And if so; are they what we (we as in westerners) would call perscribtion sleeping pills?
Q336_R37_C1 Good
There is a sleep clinic at the Hamad. It was there that I discovered that I had sleep apoenea; and they have treated that now. Its abslutely amazing to sleep all night every night; {except when I forget and have caffeine; or a fizzy drink by mistake) - first time in over 40 years! Go to the second floor (the one above ground floor)in the OutPatient Dept and ask at room 215 for the sleep clinic. They will direct you as to what you have to do to be assessed. You will need a Hamad Health Card (100 QR) for this. Angelwings.
Q336_R37_C2 Bad
Thanks for the info. What did they do in order to dignose you? And how long did it take? And do you know if you can get sleeping pills? Great that you are able to sleep all night. I have not done that since moving to Qatar. My sleeping patterns are up and down; more down :(
Q336_R37_C3 Bad
I had to stay overnight at the Hamad Hosp; while a couple monitored me all night from another room. I was wired up all over the place; which for me wasn't too comfortable; and then left to 'sleep'... which I did very little of anyway as I didn't like the 'wiring'. I was also diagnosed by the Maxillo Facial Surgeon; who checked the size of my jaw; tongue etc etc; and noted that this was one of the causes of my apnoea. I didn't do the 'sleeping pills run' as I had an operation instead to alter my jaw and remove a bit of my tongue (sounds gross; but wasn't really that bad). But this is definitely the route to take; as pills may not be the answer for you... maybe there is something else wrong that can be corrected. Hope you get 'relief' soon...I know what you're going thru! Angelwings
Q336_R37_C4 Bad
I really don't think they would find anything wrong with me though. I've had the same problem sleeping for years. Sometimes I have no problems sleeping; depends what is happening in my life...Stress being the main factor! So; having the odd sleeping pill to take would be great. I knew I should of made that trip to the Doctor before leaving Canada; lol. Thanks!
Q336_R37_C5 Good
Dear Charlene; i have the same problem; for about 10 years. I saw a doctor here in Hamad Outpatients; his name is Abdoul Moneim; he is a very good psichiatrist; and he prescibed me the same sleeping pills i use to take in my country; that's Zolpidem (or Stillnox); its relly good; but he will not give you more than 14 tablets. When i canot get this medicine; i use to take Tryptozol 25 mg; but only half tablet; you can find it in any farmacy without prescription. I wish you good luck and sleep well..

I'm an insomniac and rarely sleep before 3 a.m.. I once tried an over-the-counter herbal concoction called Sleep-Aid. While it made me drowsy it didn't knock me out and I had a terrific hangover the next day. Saw it the other day at the pharmacy. Terrible not being able to sleep.

Hi Julia; Thanks for your reply. It is so good to hear that there is help out there! I guess I should of just went and asked a Dr. here instead of assuming that it would be like it was in Kuwait and couldn't get anything stronger then a Advil! Hope you are getting good rest now... bajesus; I'm afraid Panaodol night would never do the trick for me. As for the luttuce juice; well; I would rather stay awake! lol. Thanks though! e46m3 I can relate for sure. Nothing worse then trying to sleep and then just laying there tossing and turning. I've learned to just get up and stay up untill I feel like I'm going to drop; lol. A lot of nights I get out of bed and stay up the whole night without any sleep! Go to bed anywhere from 5:00 to 8:00 A.M and still only get a few hours sleep...Person can't function well to say to least. I've been up for two hours this morning and it is now only 6:00! And it is moving day..... Hope to hear you are getting some much needed rest! Thanks everyone; Charlene
Q336_R37_C9 Bad
Have you made sure that you're cutting out all caffeine before sleeping? It takes 6 hours to flush out caffeine from the body; which is found in not only the obvious; like tea and coffee; but also in fizzy drinks like coke; seven-up etc; tonic water (very; very bad!!); soda water; beer; and sparkling wines and sparkling mineral water. Anything with bubbles can activate the brain instead of allowing it to sleep. Also; chocolate is a sleep depriver too. If you're taking any of the above within six hours of going to bed; then you'll have sleep problems if you react to them. Most folk don't think about the chocolate biscuit with a cuppa; late on in the day; but that's saying goodbye to sleep! regardless of what stress you are or aren't under. I stayed awake for four days once; when I was drinking just tonic water (I don't have a sweet tooth). A friend told me of his similar situation when he'd had a tonic water in a 'mixer' drink. He also took four days to figure out what was wrong...and e.....

I would like to get some opinion about online job recruitment sites like bayt ;gulftalent etc.. Do they really consider the CV's send ? Has anybody got jobs via these online sites ?
Q337_R4_C1 Good
Hi; I posted a forum topic on same last week; it seems that the answer is no; I have never heard back from any of them.
Q337_R4_C2 Good
these sites definitely reflect the lack of understanding of recruitment in people who designed them what they do is to match you on very limited criteria such as the last industry you worked in. What I mean is: if for example you've worked in Oil & Gas for years; but your last job (even just 6 momths) was in pharmaceuticals; then they will match you with pharmaceuticals! Working in HR I look on CVs posted on Gulf Talent only in desperate times and to be honest never employed anyone through these web sites. So; if you're looking for a job; I would suggest uploading your CV on Gult Talent or Bayt just in case you get lucky; but spend most of your efforts applying directly through companies' web sites and going in to the companies to hand in your CV. Good luck!
Q337_R4_C3 Good
hi; even the same with me .. i applied for many post in gulf talent and bayt and in return i got a mail from gulf talent saying that the post is closed ... its always the same.. got bored to fill the application almost from past 7 months am applying for these .. no reply from them.. got vexed up... its better to try in some other way .. rather than wasting time in filling up those applications ...

@ OP...what is your opinion on all those points...:)
Q337_R16_C3 Good
I use them a lot for a variety of uses as I live in Dukhan. 5 years ago if you called and asked for a taxi tomorrow they would say that nothing was available until 3am two weeks on Tuesday. Now they say yes no problem; call back to confirm the details; call the day before to remind me and call when he is on the way. I have never had a problem with the drivers except sometimes they are clearly under a lot of pressure and stressed. Maybe people could show some compassion for the drivers who live under difficult conditions so you get a cheap service. By the way I find the blatant racism on this website offensive. Most forums would not allow it. It is outrageous to define people by their nationality and such serious allegations; if not able to prove are simply slanderous.
Q337_R16_C4 Good
1) Don't use them much except in and out of airport. However; had bad experience with an $$$$$$$$ (as told by the driver himself...tried to run away with my bag) and an ************ (asked for more than the amount on meter as tip to provide better living for his 7-8 kids back home. I only asked him why so many if you cant afford. I walked out without being asked the second time). 2) They know the route; never had to direct them but some did try to use the long route only to be denied by me. 3) NA 4) Dont know. 5) Not in the list ...:) 6)Refer 2. 7) Just OK...for 10-15 minutes I am not looking for former.

I agree with you Tinkerbell; they used to be polite and do what the customer wants and set the meter on entering the cab. Everything is the opposite now; no meters; they think you are foreign with loads of money. They chat too much in the car and ask questions which is none of their business. They decide where they want to go; NOT where you want to go; if it doesn't suit them; they shake their head and drive off!! If only there was another taxi company; then Karwa will start to pull up their socks!

the author of that article seemed to have no clue as to the country's appeal. First of all; he made it seem as the only arabic people interested in studying were Qataris and Egyptians (when 20% of the arab students here are from Kuwait; UAE and Saudi). He also tried to lightly mention a bit of disappointment about the fact that the 'mingling' period had no alcohol... (odd to mention it since I've never been to any educational event where there is alcohol in the UK or in Japan) He made it seem as nobody was interested in QU when the university is always full and it's a beautiful university at that. __________________________ Cost of Living; Visas; Safety Info; Tips; Pics; Vids and m

"Tallg; When Booth killed Lincoln; he shouted "" Woe to the Traitors""; similar to what Brutus said when he killed Caesar. The Western media has an inherent bias; which is very subtle. Israeli forces are called: IDF ( Israeli Defense Forces) Whereas; a Palestinian child  throwing a rock at an Israeli tank passing through his family orchard is a ""Future terrorist"" I dont support either the soldier or the rock-thrower. However; I believe in calling a spade a spade. That's why a magazine like ""The Economist"" is respectable and a media source like ""Fox News"" or ""CNN"" is a farce to promote the bias inherent in their owners. The Internet; howvere; has changed all that by breaking the monopoly of content generation and content dissipation. :-) zaki the duckie"

Tallg; I have had remarks like 'what have you cooked'  or stick to poetry; which were completely irrelavant to the topic so don't be disappointed. It is a healthy article for many. I wanted to add few excerpts from Dr. Tidu Maini; who is a adviser to 'Sheikha Mouza'. He says 'developing countries will fail if they do not invest in education and research and convert their economies into knowledge based ones'. So there is a lot of interest being generated into research and knowledge; particularly in energy; environment and healthcare.

islamonline might legalize their use but they still won't let them into Qatar. Go figure. Just like liquor; upu can't bring it in but you can drink gallons of it once you've arrived. Talk about double standards.
Q338_R42_C8 Bad
the liquor ban i can understand. QDC will never allow anything or anyone to pose a threat to the revenues of their monopoly. the sex toys i'm a little puzzled about. if muslim scholars say they're alright..why are they still banned? And I can't imagine the Qatari government would entertain the thought of allowing a QDC-type monopoly to run sex shops around the country (imagine having to acquire a license for these shops. based on your marital status not your annual income of course :p)

There is land route via Saudi Arabia. You have to cross Qatar- Saudi border; then Saudi-UAE border. Both borders u will have to spend atleast one hour for clearance. Then you have to pay road insurance for both the countries(ie. Saudi and UAE). The road in between qatar- saudi border and saudi-UAE border is not that good. Extra care is required. UAE border post; you may have to scan your eye for entry visa purposes that can take sometime. Altogether you have to spend 6 to 7 hours..... enjoy your trip

Abudhabhi is in UAE which is very big compared to Qatar and u can move to Sharjah; Dubai; ajman; fujairah and manymore places without visa; entertainment and social life is good in Abudhabhi; 2. Living standards are good in Aubdhabhi; 3. Rentwise both cities offer you houses at same prices. 4. Traffic congesetion is more in Doha compared to Abudhabhi; So i would have preferred Abudhabhi

Hug her; its ok at the airport
Q340_R88_C2 Bad
Thanks. But in other situations? Meeting and saying goodbye in public.
Q340_R88_C3 Good
I prefer to avoid in other public settings; you can never be sure of these things.
Q340_R88_C4 Good
yes better to avoid hugging in public...even holding hands...
Q340_R88_C5 Good
Physical show of love/affection towards each other by adult opposite sexes in public is something that should to be avoided in Qatar for obvious reasons. If the reason was not obvious; you wouldn't have asked this question.
Q340_R88_C6 Good
"I do not think anybody gives a damn about what you do when you are sure that u r not doing anything wrong. As far as hugging in public at the airport... nobody will care. But do restrict yourself to hugging only. Check wikipedia about definition of 'HUG"". Different country has many different ways of hugging which may be little akward here. Just be decent and life will be good."
Q340_R88_C7 Good
c'mon... this is a hug we are talking about... not sex... is this country that far gone? A hug and a friendly kiss is not going to be a problem... i'm sure of it.
Q340_R88_C8 Good
Yes go ahead but make sure you draw the line there.

So far anyone I've met that is with Al Jazeera international seems very content. They have generally good packages (or at least from what I hear) and comfortable accomodations. The staff is diverse with a large number of employees from the UK. I think it should be a good experience. But; really there are no 'suprises' ; but you will really have to come and experience it for yourself. You may love it and someone else may hate it and vise versa.

Q342_R1
Hello; My employer got me a business visa and not a working visa. They said that it's hard to get a work visa so they will just fix my work visa when I get there. Does this really happen? They also said they'll book me a return ticket; but I failed to ask why. I worry that they could just throw me elsewhere when they become unhappy with my work performance...Hoping someone could enlighten me on this; thanks.
Q342_R1_C1 Good
It takes time to apply for a work visa. Another thing it will take also some time to process your papers there in P.I. They booked you a return ticket because you will not be allowed by P.I. immigration to board with only one way ticket. You're on a business visa and you need to come back to where you came from. That is only for formality sake so you can passed thru Immigration. Better have your medical check up there before coming here. Like chest x-ray and blood stool urine lab test. If you fail here you will be sent back.
Q342_R1_C2 Bad
what's exactly Legal issue in here?
Q342_R1_C3 Good
Business visa conversion to Work Permit is quite a usual process here.
Q342_R1_C4 Good
"Usual process while I was there in 2008 also. Takes time to get the work visa. ""... they could just throw me elsewhere when they become unhappy with my work performance..."" When you have your work visa later; you'll need an exit permit from your sponsor / employer every time you go out at the airport; so it is suggested that you do keep them happy with your work performance ... of course; you will; I'm just saying."
Q342_R1_C5 Bad
Thanks a lot for all your responses. Poea; our govt agency here which handles work matters abroad; told me that I could have a problem with my employment since I only hold business visa.
Q342_R1_C6 PotentiallyUseful
Another friend of mine mentioned that some employers who are unhappy with the performance of their employees use that business visa as an excuse in terminating the unperforming employee. The employer will exit the employee to a nearby country; saying that they will just fix the work visa but in reality; they will already terminate the employee.
Q342_R1_C7 Good
this is a very normal thing.. once you got here your business visa should be converted to working visa. The problem arises in the Immigration in Philippines. They will ask lots of questions and squeeze in some out of nowhere questions.. Just be prepared and act one that knows the Law.If you fail to pass thru the immigration; they will definitely get the last penny you have in you pocket. I felt bad to some people who are a victim of this. There was already a report in yahoo maktob stating how cruel the immigration officers in asking for some money for the individual to get out of the country! Aren't they supposed to let that person pass peacefully? I hate to say this but ; my tax when I was still working in Manila;paid them well enough... so they should serve us well and with respect instead of bullying us for the sake of money! :D Just my 2 cents here!
Q342_R1_C8 Bad
Many thanks luke_137. At least if this is a common practice; i can put my mind at ease. And that thing about the immigration sounded new to me; thanks for warning me. This is my first to go out of the country on a business so I'm a bit wary; not to mention the fact that I am a direct hire of the company.
Q342_R1_C9 PotentiallyUseful
luke_137; 1) You know why does this issue exist? There is a heavy abuse of the Business visa concept. Filipinos find their ways to buy this type of visa for the purpose of coming to Qatar and searching a job here. Which is illegal. Your immigration fellows only use your own criminal approach to this matter. One part of the mafia is buying the illegal visas. Another part of the mafia wants to have their fat piece out of it. Simple. YOUR own criminal action leads to your immigration officers’ criminal actions. YOU ALL are involved in this vicious circle; as one criminal group. STOP buying the illegal visas; and this will cut the ground from under the feets of your fellow-immigration officers; and they will stop demanding thier share. Sunny ; as an exception; it does not apply to you. Unlike others; you got your business visa legally; issued by your hiring Company. Other hundreds and hundreds of your fellow filipinos abuse this law. And then they complain that other law abusers want to .....
Q342_R1_C10 Bad
Thank you for your information and appreciate that you had said that to me. I got your point.Why should we blame a person who wanted to work for their family? Lucky you; you came from a good country :)I wonder why your are here in qatar? :D But still people who bought the visa are part of the crime. Just got lucky i'm on a family visa when I came here. :D

"Hi Alex; You'll find the gay scene here a little odd. It's not acceptable and actually illegal to be gay here. If you are caught you will possibly be lashed and deported. That being said there are many MANY MANY gay men here. There is quite a thriving underground gay scene. No specific bars; but if you hang out at the Pearl; Admirals or Cloud Nyn; you defintely run into a few. Now; from what I understand there is a lot of ""boy-toy"" ""sugar-daddy"" action here. The Arab men aren't really comfortable with having a relationship; so they tend to stick to just sex. If you want lots of stuff like cars and apartments; there the guys you go too. If you want a relationship; unfortunatly; you might be out of luck. There are some really great gay guys here; and most of them want relationships; but they say it's just really hard to maintain one here (not surprising because heterosexual relationships are hard to maintain here too).

Q343_R39_C1 Good
yes it is true that it will be useless because even if you pass the prometric exam; you are not allowed to apply for a SCH medical license and dataflow verification because one of the requirement is to have a 2 years minimum experience. better to have that experience first in your home country then come back after you already have that experience.

is there any way to get experience in Qatar as a pharmacist ?
Q343_R39_C3 Good
how? before you can work here in qatar; you have to apply a dataflow verification and sch medical license but how can you apply for that if you dont have experience. hospitals and clinics are not accepting applicant without the medical license and dataflow verification. if you want to get experience as a pharmacist; you have to get it in your home country.

Basically there is NO point in thinking of amount you will save; because with this salary you cant live a under average life even!; yes as others have said; you need to forget eating;travelling;calling your family back home;enjoying weekends and ofcourse stay in a room which is already occupied by atleast 5 people; then surely you can save upto 1000 Riyals. But this all is easier said and written than done!. So my friend dont think to accept the offer with this salary! If your company is providing with free accomodation; food and travel then may be you could save upto 1000 Riyals!

Giving the company a blank cheque simply means you are giving them the permission to do whatever they want with you later on. You will be putting yourself in lot's of trouble. The asking for a blank cheque speaks much about their dirty minds.

Matt; I've been here pretty much since 2008; and overall the place has improved since then. Certain laws and regulations change; and it can be a frustrating place; but on the whole you can live a very nice life here. I moved from London; and adjusted pretty easily. Come with an open mind and you'll be fine. There are plenty of people in the same position and you'll meet other expats easily. What I will say; is you have to build your life here and it can be an easy place to hate if you don't make the effort....especially for the wife. Hopefully she's outgoing; and it shouldn't be a problem to meet people. Choosing where to live is a big part! Maersk is in West Bay so possibly get an amazing apartment here close to all the bars and restaurants and City Center for shopping. Better for the wife if she can walk to places....Get somewhere short term in West Bay to start and give yourself a chance to learn about Doha and where you want to be permanently located.

cs2009; Yes your TV will work here; its a 220/240v 50Hz supply out here so all of your electrodomestics will be OK; However if you've got to pay the shipping yourself I would think twice because there are some great bargains to be had on LCD\plasma sets at the moment.

Hi Can anyone tell me what the procedure is when first coming over to Qatar; are you given a little time to sort out your home and transport before attending work and when do companies tend to give you your furniture allowance. How do workers from blighty generally get paid into UK or Qatar banks? Who are the best internet and satalite providers? Whats the weather like!!! lol
Q345_R67_C1 Good
depend who you working for. I am sure every company have their own way doing things. For us ... we were given a company housing for the first 3 months ; then they give you allowance to look somewhere else. We receive our furniture allowance as soon as my husband pass his probation period. The first 2 weeks husband get a car and a driver to go to work; after that we rent a car till we received our resident permit and able to buy a car. Internet so far only 1 provider : Qtel.So take it or leave it... you dont have a choice. The pay tranferred to our local bank; then every few months we send the money to the UK. Anyway ... welcome to QL; do use the 'search' button on the top right to search any question you have in mind. Anything you want to ask in perticular just post away :-) The weather at the moment when you go outdoor just like you go inside the sauna room ...
Q345_R67_C2 Good
welcome to qatar! usualy you have to start your work next day after arrival; max within 3 days; but it depends on your company... some give you 1 week or even more... usually furniture allowance is given after the probation perod; i.e. 3 months. You can have your car only after you get your RP which will take at least 1 month.. so shortly; be prepared for a bit uncomfortable life first couple of months till you settle down; start getting used to your new life; sort out your new friends issue and so on.. but again; it might be various depends on the company and your personal ability to adapt a new environment.. good luck and have fun in Doha!! **********
Q345_R67_C3 Good

Homes R Us in Hyatt Plaza. Bo Concept in City Center. Souq Al Haraj in Najma area. ID Design in The Mall. Origins (www . originssofas . com) I usually end up buying from Home Center because it's relatively inexpensive; and at times I take things apart and customize them. Some of the couches in ID Design are very cute; colorful; modern and at a decent price if you are looking for something nicer than Home Center. But Doha still lacks a great basics store for furniture. That's why everyone is waiting on Ikea.

I read about a couple that drove to Saudi to shop at the Ikea. And then arted it all back. http://www.dohamums.com/blog/a-trip-to-ikea-dhahran.html If you're going to be in Qatar a while; that seems almost worth the effort! :) The furniture here sucks! The few stores with modern lines like ID Design and The One are really overpriced; like Colt said. Home Centre and Homes r Us are good only for bits n bobs like shelves; etc. The more important stuff is mostly elaborate and heavy. Gah!

I find it difficult to find modern living furniture here; there is only one popular place......HOME CENTRE.

That's the problem with furniture in Doha. Look at Bombay Company in the Mall and their US website and compare the prices. We wanted a bed that cost 17;000 riyals in their shop here and on the US website $1000; exact same bed. The silly (Lebanese) manager at the Mall shop said no discount; only for repeat customers! They wanted to maintain exclusivity. I think he meant the exclusivity of fleecing gullible customers or the exclusion of reason. One of the two. Even if I were to ship it from the US it would be cheaper buying it from the website.

Tell you what though; say that Khalifa Saleh recommended you (Saleh Haroon's son) and you might even get an extra discount! ^_^ As for Ikea; I have bought two mattresses from them in the past; I've had them go wonky or unshaped within 6 months and Ikea refused to even talk to me. __________________________ I Love Qatar - http://www.iloveqatar.net

That is the question! Is it worth bringing furniture to Doha? I'd be looking for apartments when I get there - how are the fully furnished places? Furniture ok? Or is it wiser to look for a semi-furnished place and bring my stuff? Thanks S
Q347_R1_C1 Good
Hi there! Personally I would not bring furniture when it comes to a fully furnished apartment in Doha ; as they do have the basic stuff being put in already;such as tv; tv cabinet; wardrobe; sofa bed . Like me; I will be very soon moving to one of the fully furnished apartment as well; n now have the difficulties getting rid of my bed; sofa; tv n cabinets - omg it sure will gonna take some time y'know; so judging from my own experience; I would not recommend you to bring too many of your own furniture :) Oh and welcome to Doha! :)
Q347_R1_C2 Bad
Thanks Soulfood - well; isn't there an option to get a semi furnished place?
Q347_R1_C3 Good
Yes there is and it tends to be cheaper if u choose this option; but then again it also means they might not provide too many furnitures to you. I think it varies too when it comes to different property companies providing just what sort of furnitures; so it's important to find out from each of them if you do wanna go for a semi furnished one :)
Q347_R1_C4 PotentiallyUseful
semi-furnished generally doeasn't mean what it does elsewhere. Here I believe it means curtains; stove; oven; dishwaher and washing machine.

At this point you only have a temporary contract. You must past the medical exam which takes about a month to get your results. Meanwhile; you won't be issued a Qatar ID until you get your medical results and sign your permanent contract. Without a Qatar ID you won't be able to rent an apartment. Majority of the buildings have electrical and plumbing problems due to the unskilled foreign laborer's. Therefore; rent a fully furnished all-inclusive or company housing till you feel you might stay over a year.

Q347_R1_C10 Good
I agree. Do not bring your furniture because most apartments around Doha are fully furnish.I notice the difference between fully & semi is only 2k Qatari Riyals. I made a mistake bring my own furniture as I was recommended to bring.But the shipment container was paid for so I don't mind. So now i just mix my one set furniture which consist of 3 seater; 2 seater & one seater;carpet & one table with the apartment's furniture. Furniture at home centre are not that expensive IMO. if you do find a apartment or villa semi furnished.

Ask any pathan (Pakistani nationals identified by their unique national dress) that you come across. Chances are good he himself might be an owner of a pickup. If not he would definitely arrange one for you. Or if you could drive down to Alfardan bus stand; you can find such big pickups parked in line with pathans sitting in the driving seats. The rate will obviously depend on from where you have to pickup your furniture and where to drop; but it should be within or around QR100. Bargaining will possibly bring down what you end up paying. One word of caution! Used furnitures are the primary source of blood sucker bed bugs.

hi there! don't expect too much.  your package includes basic; tranport allow HRA etc depending on what grade are you and 10% increment of basic salary every year depending on your boss' evaluations.

"just for everyone's info. the said annual ticket on each qatar airways staff is governed by their staff handbook. and it is always ""Subject to Load"" and not ""Confirmed"" so even you are on your annual leave you have to always wait at the staff check-in counter if there will be seats available. - live your life as simple as you are - money doesn't create man; but it is the man who created money - don't do what others say; just listen to them; but do what you feel good"

Q349_R30_C9 PotentiallyUseful
i think it will not be the same. there should be adifferent fee for each rating. if i'm not mistaken that's how it goes with most of the airlines. if you ask me; there's no need to bring your tools. most of the work are done by mechanics anyway :-)     goodluck!

I accept your source that there has been a fire there. At some point. But when did it happen and was it the original cause of the sudden closure?

Q351_R6
How much is deemed acceptable to tip a taxi driver? I was told by a couple of people who ave lived here for years that you dont tip them but i feel that as they are really helpful with assisting me and my kids in and out of the taxi; they deserve a tip. Also what do people do when a taxi driver doesnt turn on the meter on a very short trip and at the end of the trip; says pay as you wish? How am i to know what to pay him if i havent taken that route before? Any advice?
Q351_R6_C1 Good
give them 3 or 5 riyals extra will make them over the moon nadt. Last night our taxi from the airport started from 18 QR; since our house just next door to the airport the meter only reach to 25 QR. My husband give 35QR because the driver was so helpfull helping us out with the cases.
Q351_R6_C2 Good
Thx nov; i usually tip bout 5 riyals for trip so i guess this is ok..cheers..
Q351_R6_C3 Bad
My criteria in tipping the taxi driver are: 1- Don't ask me no questions about me or don't tell me where you from. I got my Confession Booth for those moments. 2- Don't drive like you are driving Miss Daisy or some Indianapolis 500 racing stock car in the roads. Better use those turn signals and do your yielding. I have enough of the local population egocentric driving habits. 3- Don't be smelling like Garlic or some lost flowering fragrance; it just gives me a headache. I Don't want memories of the local malls. 4- Better have the meter on and pronounce those numbers properly. 5- and learn to difference between; drive Straight ahead; turn left and turn right. Then I might tip you... With a Thank you! The Red Pope of Qatar Living

Tip if the driving is good and don't if it isn't. Please do NOT reward bad driving. Please ask your driver to pull over SAFELY and not stop in the middle of the road.

i normally leave tips about QR 5; but then again i was on my own. Like when i am having breakfast on my own in one of the cafe in villagio ... my bill come to like QR 40 to QR 50 ; i left QR 5 as a tip. IMO it is a fair amount.

daiwai ... if you spent QR 50; 10 percents would be only QR 5. But when you eat in the hotel ... you will easily spent QR 600 to QR 700 ; on top of that they will charge you another 17 percents ... and you still have to leave 10 percents for the tip? but then again if you can afford to pay the bill ... surely you can afford to leave some $$$ for tipping ???  
Q351_R11_C6 Bad
Then I don t add any more; even though I suspect the waiting staff may bot get the tip. In the Us they expact 20%cnow. The Ritz Carlton no longer add service; an d the staff get the tip - at least in the Italien restaurant.......I belive the 17% is a combo of service and tax...  If you're living life on the edge; you've got too much room.

when there is service charge.. dont tip coz its included.. and when the waiter is bad.. again dont tip... lol.. else 5-10% depending on bill value..
Q351_R11_C9 Good
I think it's very rare for the service charge included in the bill to go to the waiters. I don't even know if 'service' actual means the waiter service. Best to ask the waiter if they get it or not. If they don't then leave a tip if you think they deserve it; for the amount you think they deserve. I hate the American culture of always tipping. A normal tip should reward normal service; with a bigger tip rewarding service above your expectations. But if the service is poor (as it so often is here) then they haven't earnt a tip in my opinion.
Q351_R11_C10 Bad
the funny thing is that mostly the waiter is not getter that service charge...   If you're looking for a problem; you're probably gonna find one.

(If my earn will be above 100QR per month on tips? ) Share your experiences please :) Matus
Q351_R15_C1 Good
Please note that for every 10 person you will serve on the bar there are only 2 possible person that can give you a tip personally. Here in Qatar tips are not usually considered unless by the white peoples. But you need also to consider the company policy on tipping; for there are some which is centralized. But if you're expecting to received 100 riyals tip per day; I can say there's a big possibilities that you might not get it; besides; for sure you're not just the only one who's working there as a waiter.

Q351_R20_C4 Good
You can most certainly use your cash card; providing it's hooked up to a world ATM network (Cirrus; etc.) or has a credit card symbol. I was not charged a fee by QNB (Qatar National Bank); only by my home bank (which I fully expected). As for an ATM in arrivals; unfortunately; I've not seen one. I may have missed it; though; as I've been wisked through by the greeting service both times. If you are going to a hotel first; you can either use an ATM or take cash and exchange it. I did this (exchanged cash) the first time at the Intercon(tinental) without difficulty. Just ask when you check in. If you are going to your accommodation; malls and shops are open late now with it being Ramandan (1 am or so). Ask your driver for advice. City Center Doha (the big mall); which I live across from; is like this. 10 minutes and the money problem is solved. Established shops will take a credit card should you need to make a purchase before you can get to the ATM. However; Doha is pretty wired. You ca.....
Q351_R20_C5 Bad
Thanks for your comments and advice. The company have arranged limo to collect me and my son from the airport and to take us to the hotel. I was not sure if I would need to tip the driver or not. I think that I will just use my card to withdraw cash from my UK bank account when I first get to Doha so that I have some cash to use for small purchases and I will pay for larger purchases with my card. Thanks again for your help.
Q351_R20_C6 Good
Mmm... well; I can see your point there. However; as you're just arriving in the country; no one is expecting you to have riyals ready to distribute. Or I'd hope not. Besides; the ATM spits out bigger bills than you'd tip to a driver (as in every country; UK included). So then you'd have the trouble of having to get one broken down. If you're going to the hotel; and you really want to tip the driver; just ask him to wait for a second. Run in; tell them what you want to do; and change a bill. Or borrow 10 riyals from the bellhop; tell them you're changing money in just a second; and then give it back after you've changed money. Truthfully; though; I wouldn't sweat it too much. You'll have other things to occupy yourself with. Which hotel? The Intercon is quite nice. The breakfast buffet is gigantic. Literally 15 kinds of bread (at least). Fresh fruit juices. A whole long table filled with fruit and cheeses.

Almost everybody here for sure goes to Lulu Hypermarket for groceries. It is very annoying for these cashiers to pay your change with CANDIES.

That way I won't get annoyed at thinking I am losing money. They could do this without causing half the arguments. Do I want to pay more for my shopping?

Customer Service in Qatar? Answer: Does not exist!
Q352_R58_C4 Good
"One of the best customer services I have experienced in Doha is at the Commercial Bank. They never neglect your emails when you complain; they try to understand every detail of your problem and give you options to solve it; and they keep following up until you are satisfied. I have a similar pleasant experience with the manager of the service center of United Cars. He makes sure to read your emails and sends instant instructions to his employees to fix the problems. Unfortunately there are companies who don't bother if their customers are happy or not. They come from a background of: ""take it or leave it...you don't have any other option"" My brother experienced this lately with QGRABS. They sell some cheap quality offers and they don't bother to even apologize; not to mention a compensation."

Do any of you use a GPS to get around in Qatar? If so; does it help or hurt more?

No need wasting your money for specific GPS unit; all you need is just a mobile phone with GPS capability. Install it with GARMIN for mobile and complete the map of the area you need.

I cant understand why people buy electronics in Qatar. I get all my stuff off of Amazon and have it shipped by Aramex. It costs me about 25% less even with the cost of shipping. Whatever you buy in Doha will be overpriced and out of date. The only advantage would be you have a local one year warranty; but those are rarely honoured anyways.

@Secretagent69: How did you shipped by Aramex; do u need to have account on Aramex? I checked amazon.com and the price is really good; please help me i want to buy a laptop. Thanks in advance :)
Q353_R25_C3 PotentiallyUseful
Sure. Just go to the Aramex office and set up an account. It's cheap and easy. Then use your credit card on Amazon to buy the laptop and have it shipped to Doha by Aramex. It will arrive in about a week.

Q353_R25_C5 PotentiallyUseful
Online transactions are safe if you know your way around a pc. If your in doubt - use a pre paid credit card. I use aramex as well. The service is not all that great. They received two items from amazon on the same date and shipped one a week after the other. But amazon customer service is very good. You don't need to go their office to set up the account. You can register online from their website for a ship and shop account as well. Only reason why I would buy something from here over amazon/aramex is when I feel the local warranty is required or if I need it immediately.

I purchased a Nokia mobile phone from Carrefour about three months ago. I can barely hear out of my phone now; which is a real pain in the rear; to say the least.

you can have it repaired on Nokia (Consolidated Gulf. Co. W.L.L.) in Salwa Showroom at 443-0666. if it's still under warranty; they will replace it with free of charge.

Q353_R73_C6 Good
They can't do it on the spot bec they have other things to fix or attend which was first on the line. you have to leave it and comeback after a few days. As ive said; Amoud; its probably under service warranty of 1 or 2 years not so sure with 2 years. so it will be free for now. Im sure carrefour will just bring it to Consolidated for SErvice afterwards and it might take a longer time than bringing it directly to Consolidated.
Q353_R73_C7 Good
"They may keep your phone for a few days to fix it; longer depending on the availability of spare parts if needed . If you need a temp phone let me know; I have a few lying around the house (I should be at the Mums coffee Thursday morning). Good thing about Nokia is; that even if you dont have the receipt they register the serial number and have it on the system so your warranty is still valid even if you lost the receipt. ___________________________________________________ ""Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"""

If you travel throughout the GCC you will notice the increase in border security procedures. Yes even with only finger prints they can track you as all GCC countries are sharing the same data base. Depending on what you are being deported for will have a bearing on you being able to work in another GCC country. Along with your prints your case file will be accessible to other immigration authorities to scrutinize

Q355_R24_C7 Good
Guys; It depends on the nature of the ban. Normally a ban is a no entry situation. If he is having a no entry stamp to Dubai then he will not be able to get visa to any of the GCC countries. The Immigration system of all the other countries will ave details of the person and it will normally block the visa. I know some guys in India unable to get visa to any other GCC countries because of the ban in Dubai.

"The accommodation is perhaps a couple of kilometers from the center of old Doha; probably four kilometers from West Bay. I have heard that they don't like to employ Indians but I don't know for sure. They move extremely slowly whenever I have any dealings with them. Don't respond to emails; never answer a direct question; and don't return calls. They don't permit staff to access Internet resources regardless of need for job. I would imagine the work is secure because they are definitiely not a popular employer. Getting ""looked after"" is relative. You will be better looked after than someone in a labor camp; not as well looked after as someone feeding from the SIDRA trough."

HELP. I am currently dating a man who lives in Qatar for work and is from the UK. Lately he has been talking about me moving over there.  What do I need to know?

"Well; for one thing; you don't just move to Qatar. You have to have a residence visa; which means you have to be sponsored; usually by a family member or an employer. They're not going to let your BF sponsor you. Can you live together? If you don't mind living illegally; sure; you can live together. Whether this in fact turns into a problem will depend on a whole lot of factors; but you should be aware that it CAN turn into the sort of problem that spells p-r-i-s-o-n and d-e-p-o-r-t-a-t-i-o-n. You can drink; lots of people do (I do); but you will be in a Muslim country under Sharia law. You would be well advised to be very discreet. Lastly; Qatar would not be my first choice if having ""a good time"" were all that important to me. I think of it more as a place that one navigates as best one can. It's not all that bad a place to live; but you do have to be somewhat resourceful."

unless you really really really and I mean really like the guy! Come for a short visit and see it for yourself; check the place out. And as k977etc pointed out you'll need to find a sponsor; (i.e. employer) to be able to move here.
Q358_R52_C3 Good
Qatar is amongst the more liberal of Gulf countries I believe; which isn't saying enough because the Gulf does not even compare to the liberality of the fertile crescent Arab countries like Syria; Lebanon and Jordan. Though I personally don't drink; the vast majority of people I know do; and they do not seem to have a problem accessing it (which makes for some interesting weekends I can assure you!) Where in the US do you live? And what are your qualifications? Have you considered looking for a job here? If you are thinking about getting married to the guy; I believe he can sponsor you; contact the American Embassy for more info (though i never found them to be particularly resourceful lol). Their number is (974) 4884101. Good luck! Don't let one man's dream become another's nightmare
Q358_R52_C4 Good
"Yes; you can live together - You'll need to be discreet; i.e. do not tell your muslim friends and acquaintances about it. Yes; you can go out for drinks - No need to be discreet here as long as you consume in bars and night clubs (which are almost always in hotels) and your home. During Ramadan you can only drink up at home and it's common practice to stock up on booze before this period. Also; never ever get into trouble with the cops when drunk. Drink driving is definitely not advisable. But; I agree fully with ""OOO"". Come in on a holiday and see for yourself before you decide."
Q358_R52_C5 Good
Here is not Heaven. They have laws that the West does not follow. Here being close to or committing adultry; fornication or sodomy is not allowed. Also; drinking is not allowed.

On 1 side there are the women & children of the original owners of the land who were living peacefully like every nation on earth; and on the other side there are the women & children who left their countries around the world; came to invade a country which don't belong to them; started killing the families of the original owners; and stole their homes.

I do not support in any way the treatment of the Palestinians by the Israelis and the tragic loss of life of innocents is unforgiveable. What I do not understand though is why certain Palestinian factions continue to fire home made rockets into Israel. What good does it do? It takes away sympathy from the Palestinian cause and it causes innocent deaths on the Israeli side of the border. Worse of all; everyone knows that the Israelis retaliate with much greater force and cause many more innocent palestinian deaths. Stop giving Israel an excuse to kill. Use brain power not gun powder. Look to the examples of Ghandi and Mandela to make change and get the Isrealis to return to 1967 borders. These stupid rockets just cause more unecessary deaths.

Unfortunately All the job interviews or offers I get are totally bad. is it that hard to get a good job in Qatar or what? if you could guys provide me with a good recruiting company or name of any good company that hiring now. Thank you.
Q361_R1_C1 Good
Hey ! Welcome to Qatar. Every job market has its fair share of positives and negatives. Getting a job in qatar is quite tough depending on the channel you use to source for jobs. Also depends on your expectations. There is vast majority of job seekers in Qatar who consider themselves qualified in many ways but often find out that the expectations of the employer are much higher. Also; you should try to be more specific. For eg: in the question you placed; you could have easily mentioned what kind of position you are looking out for to let everyone know in one go. But you chose not to. In addition to this; most ministries and govt organizations are implementing qatarization policies. So you will find a decrease in very 'high paying' jobs for expatriates. The private firm would not probably pay you as much. To avoid dissapointment you could try to filter the interviews coming to you. Ask before-hand what to expect in the interviews. The sources of recruitment / agencies are easily access.....
Q361_R1_C2 Bad
Crazy88; Thanks for your reply; you were right on why I didn't mentioned the job position I am applying for; but I was just saying in General; I mean I wasn't asking for a job more than asking about any company that hiring now and why is it difficult to find a high professionalism organization. about the recruiting agencies; I did many search and got many recruitment agencies; but thought if someone could provide with a good one.

You don't have to be defensive. I pointed out a defect that you can work on to get better chances. It is not about social network Vs Email to your boss. You can get a slight chance for a job offer through qatarliving. Would you rather hire someone that can't write correct English if you can hire someone that can? Also; why would you even mention what I have on another thread? You don't even know the full story? Again you contradict the true meaning of professionalism. My other thread is due to people who take money and give you a fake receipt and do not deliver. How is this my fault? Good luck to you; based on my poor judgement; you might need a lot of it.

Q363_R58_C6 Good
I think it depends on your job but I would say the best payers are Saudi Arabia closely followed by Kuwait but neither of those places are pleasant enough to endure just for a few more bills in your pay cheque.

How many days does it take to finish the processing of a Work Permit?
Q365_R13_C1 Good
Just today i went for the workpermit medical. I think the process works as follows: 1. Your company applies online for WP and you get a piece of paper that it is issued. - Max 1 week. 2. They get a medical date - another week max. 3. Finger printing - another 3-4 days. 4. WP card - another 2-3 days. above days are just from my personal experience and may vary.

Tepgam your situation is slightly complicated than mine...hopefully somebody else can respond to your queries as i am not sure myself.
Q365_R13_C4 Good
these are two different things.. Tepgam67 is asking about Work permit while being on Family visa. shapil is talking about residence permit. that's what happens when unprofessional people try to give an advice. Tepgam67; if you have an RP here; to obtain a Work permit you need police clearance and the contract certified in MOL. How long it takes to finalize the process depends on several factors. ometimes it takes 3-4 days; sometimes it takes 1 month and even more. If you don't have an RP here (i.e. you are on 6 months family visa); you cannot work; and therefore you cannot obtain a Work permit.
Q365_R13_C5 Bad
QatariSon...my first response was based upon the OP which did not mention anything about the family visa and my second response after i was enlightened. Kindly revisit. Jumping the Gun is not professionalism.
Q365_R13_C6 Bad
"i am not sOn; I am sUn. thank you. she didn't mention family visa; but she stated clearly ""Work Permit""; which needed only while you are on Family visa. What you were talking about is getting a residence permit while you are on Work Visa. completely two different visas and situations."

you are welcome; shapil; it is never late to learn. again you mix two things. You are already on Work VISA here in qatar. Based on your Work VISA you got your RP. You don't need an additional work PERMIT; since your visa is a WORK visa. Clear? Work PERMIT is required for those who are on the Family Visa and wish to work. The author of this thread is on Family Visa and already has her RP; I guess. She might stay in Qatar on Family visa without working (while you cannot stay on Work visa without working). But now she has chosen to work. And all she needs now is a PERMISSION to WORK (Work Permit). I hope this time you see the difference. If not; just drop it..

The immigration is not very keen on certain nationalities; and in practice work permits for them(including syrian) take forever. In reality; when it takes so long; employers often get frustrated and find another candidate to fill the job... and the immigration problem is easily solved without having to honestly admit that they just don't want certain nationality Don't quit your current job; and if you're still not working - keep looking for other options (outside Qatar).

Hello; I am thinking of sponsoring my husband to live in Qatar. I heard that if he gets a job; he will need to get a work permit. Are husbands able to get a work permit? And what papers will they ask for; is a police clearance letter necessary? Thanks.
Q365_R53_C1 Bad
I am from Europe and I have no problem with my visa. I can sponsor him (on a family visa?); but heard he also needs a work permit in order to start working. So my questions are a) can a husband under wife sponsorship get a work permit; b) what papers does he need; does he need police clearance for the application.
Q365_R53_C2 Good
If he is on a family visa he needs to find a job first so that the company who will hire him will be the one to process his work permit. In my case the company who hired me did'nt ask my police clearance they just get a copy of my Passport; RP and copy of my Degree Certificate.I was already a resident here in Doha for a year before I decided to look for a job.
Q365_R53_C3 Good
if you get over 7k you can sponser him with fam visa. once he is here and under your visa; He should bring a police clearance report from his home country (need to be attested by his Embassy here) so let him find a job; he will need to give the police clearance report and the company will fix him a work visa. (not the same as yours) he will still remain under your sponsorship. or different option if his job is well paid and he will get good benefits like tickets and also housing allowance he can ask his new employer to be his sponsor

Q365_R53_C6 Bad
Thanks. Is the police clearance an official requirement from the government when you apply for the family visa and work permit? Or not always needed?
Q365_R53_C7 Good
bringing him on family visit visa (6 months) and sponsoring him for the Residence permit are two different things. Even IF you are able to bring him on a Family visit visa (6 months); he won't be able to work with this type of visa. The Company who hired him will have to issue a Work Visa for him and will have to take him under its sponsorship. As for the Residence permit; you won't be able to obtain RP for him (which is necessary for the Work permit) under your sponsorship. So this is not an option for you. All you need is to TRY to bring him on Family visa 6 months. THen he will need to find a job and to move under the hiring company sponsorship.

"even for ""husband"" there are certain requirements to sponsor his wife; such as salary; position; etc. For ""wife"" those requirements are much stricter.

Q366_R24_C4 Good
Same issues here and we went to kahramaa to find out the problem.; but seems alot of people are facing the same thing and logging complaints over there. Did they increase the electricity/water rate without noticed to public?
Q366_R24_C5 Good
we have the same issue. for the past few months our bills wouldn't go up to 300QR even; but now when we checked our bill we were suprised that we need to pay 804QR! there was no reading for the water consumption but they put around 200QR as 'extra charges'. when my husband inquired about this he was told that they have increased their rate due to their 'new system' and that they will just refund whatever amount they'll owe us next month.
Q366_R24_C6 Bad
If all of our bills were estimated; then it is really unfair even if it benefits you by having less. More to worry if you have more that you are actually using. Perhaps somebody can add to this based on their experiences...
Q366_R24_C7 Good
i have the same experience but it has some readings... but the most important is that we jumped from less than 400 to 700QR this month... Grrrrr!!!!
Q366_R24_C8 PotentiallyUseful
weird; right? QEWC should really look into this matter and fix it ASAP 'cause it is really unacceptable to pay x3 of your previous bill when the fact that you have consumed almost the same e/w last month

I was offered a job in Qatar with salariy details as below with a total salary & allowance of QR15;000.00. May someone advice me on the cost of living in Qatar since I have no idea at all. Please indicate as follows : 1. Apt. rental per month 2. Price of food & groceries 3. Utility fees & such 4. Car rental per month 5. School fees for 9 years old kid and 4 years old 6. Others as necessary Thank you
Q366_R27_C1 Good
Salleh...salary is relative to what you do for a living. Having said that you can be the best judge of how good or bad your offer is once you've done some research. DO a search in QL. Plenty of threads bout cost of living in Doha. 1. 2 br apartment 8500-12000 pm 2. Groceries for two 2500 pm 3. Water + electricity 500 pm 4. Telephone+internet+cable 500-100 pm 5. Car rental 2000 pm for the likes of Corolla/civic 6. School fees....sorry no idea 7. Other....no idea..depends what your definition is Hope this helps. Good lucK!!!!!
Q366_R27_C2 Good
You really won't manage on 15;000 if your wife doesn't work. A 2-bedroom apartment will cost a minimum of 7000; car another 2000; schools are expensive...
Q366_R27_C3 Good
sorry my friend you would be lucky to break even... it would probably cost you more than you earn. you may have about QR500 left a month!
Q366_R27_C4 Bad
LOL this thread is such a reality-slap in the face; i remember back when 4000ryals was enough to live large back in the mid 1990's And now the guy is gonna make 15000 a month and we all feel bad for the struggle he will go through! Qatar is overpriced and definetly overrated; unless your a lebanese pimp i dont see how u can survive in qatar or what your doing here in the first place?
Q366_R27_C5 Good
If they can't house you then you dont take it. Or at least get it in the contract that they will pay your Housing Rent Bill as the rents increase 25% every year. If they agree then the package is good unless you are not a heavy dirnker. Bilabong is on the spot with the rates. No.5 is optional and it would depend on the length of your stay. If you Rent-a-car it will be QR2000. If you stay for above 3yrs then it would be better if you buy QR2000 pm for 3yrs you can own the car (corolla/civic) & sell it for QR 25;000-30;000 when you leave Qatar. If your wife is here & she is not working it could be damn boring for her.
Q366_R27_C6 Good
hi Salleh; after reading the above definition of leaving in qatar u might have gone craze dont feel so; what i feel is 1 Rent : if you search you will get 2 BHK at 5000-6000K 2.Food expenses for two : 1500-2000K 3.Car : 1000-1500 K (if u are buying a car) plan of staying more than 3years; 4.School : 500-600K per month; 5.Other misc. expenses : depends on you; In my opinion 10000K per month should do; think over and deicde

Sorry folks..I do confess to hijacking/sideswiping a thread or two (perhaps three?) but I'm used to posting on another website that does allow that and we get into some really great discussions that way. Didn't know it upset some folks; so I'll conduct myself more to the guidelines of the site here. I do apologize (excuse being I'm new....)
Q366_R33_C1 Good
Me too do this at times. Not a big deal...don't feel bad... at least this thread we can hijack without feeling guilty.
Q366_R33_C2 Bad
Is that I can't see a problem with going off topic if the thread is a light one; such as Paul arranging a social get-together or someone putting up a joke for everyone to have a go at or add to etc. I think the problem is if someone has started a serious thread; which requires a discussion or even an answer to a query they have (if it doesn't fit in the more serious forums); then by hijacking it kind of kills the thread and serves no purpose. Speaking as someone who found this site when in the UK; before coming over to Doha; I typed into google a question about; say; sports clubs in Doha and found a thread in QL. It was informative; but I wonder what I would have thought of the site had the thread suddenly disintegrated in people gossiping and heresay and bickering? For a start I would never had seen some of the REAL info I was looking for and given up; as probably would have the person who posted the question in the first place expecting some knowledge to be imparted! OK - am going to.....

"Um_Nooh and aquabong; With all respect to cleaners and tea boys. I do respect them a lot and if I had to use ranks; I would consider them all; way above most of the people who exercise a ""management"" position here in Qatar. Each one of them have a sad story behind them and most of them are heroes suffering under an unjust society. For your information; from where I come from; a cleaner and a person who serves tea/coffee; is regarded as important as a senior manager and their salaries sometimes are not too apart. The social benefits are equal. We grow up with a diversity of people and racism is just not part of our upbringing! My reply to Um_Nooh; came out that way because of the way she posted her question! Anybody could figure out that salaries vary in accordance with the activity you are going to exercise. Um_Nooh assumed that either we could guess her qualifications and targeted job; or whatever. My answer was deliberated for her to think about her error and at the same time to high....."
Q366_R41_C9 Bad
Nic - when i talked about lack of class and respect; it had nothing to do; and was not directed towards individuals that work as tea/coffee servers; and hence lead to me feeling offended.... it was directed to how you answered me! You were the person that I felt lacked class and respect (and that is without knowing your professional background). If you want to talk about answering; and stating things appropriately; you could have chosen your words in a more decent manner. Follow what you preach basically. The fact that not only I was offened but another member as well; who if I may add is NOT qatari; shows a lot about your approach. Please do not assume that just because I am Qatari; I do not value people that work as tea/coffee servers; or anyone else for that matter! Just as you assumed the worst in me; and thought I sterotyped them as being low class citizens; you were a hypocrite to assume that as a Qatari that is how I would think of them! The only person that acted wrongly is you.....

If you pay the penalty which is 10 Qr per day then you can renew your visa and change your sponsorship too. You have to pay your penalty only for 5 month not for 8 which is 5x30=150. 150x10 = 1500. either if you go to basmsahba or whatever they call it they will charge u the same amount and air tickets.and they will give the date . It's easy don't worry dear but you will be bane for next 2 year .

If you pay the penalty and renew your visa then you can change your sponsorship easy .if your record is good they will ask you to bring the police clearance cartifcats too or NBC (I think) from your embassy when you apply for sponsorship changing .

Q369_R28_C3 Bad
thanks for the reply guys..like i said i was just curious what others really think. i just reverted to islam and i always feel that wearing the abaya doesnt give me the right coz im not arab and all.. i thought the purpose of wearing one is not to attract attention but out in public i always get this strange look?..or maybe im just paranoid.
Q369_R28_C4 Good
You should be proud that your covering now because of your religion. Some convert and cant manage to cover with abaya at all. Maybe the strange looks are only in your head. Good luck and Ramadan Kareem!!
Q369_R28_C5 PotentiallyUseful
I was just about to post the same thing... here is my otherwise irrelevant two cents: I have been in many areas and functions where abaya is not an option; it is mandatory. As a *white* woman; I wouldn't think twice about people staring at me; thats their problem; divert your gaze etc... perhaps you are bit nervous at first; but you will become increasingly comfortable and not be concerned at all you will be proud of yourself
Q369_R28_C6 Good
Lol; anyone can wear an Abaya. But if someone goes on the current trend of TIGHT fitting ones with shiny stones and designs; without the Hijab; and with DRAG makeup or in some cases they just let it all fly back while they walk into a mall making it look like an advocate coat. So whats the purpose of wearing the Abaya again; if you want to show your body to the world? lol; when I see the other nationalities wearing an abaya apparently they dont do it to cover their body; they do it to look pretty and to look Qatari :) Correct me if Im wrong. Hope your not one among these people. Once I was in Landmark and I saw a Qatari (I guess) with an open Abaya wearing Super man tee inside. What the devil did she want to potray? Lord Almightey knows alone.
Q369_R28_C7 Good
"Every non-Qatari woman that I have come across wearing an Abaya is wearing it to try and pretend to be Qatari; not for religious reasons.

Hi; My husband and myself will be relocating to Qatar soon; and would like to know the typical business dress code in Doha for Non Nationals. Is it OK for men to wear short sleeve shirts? For women; I am assuming the more conservative; the better..but what's more popular there?? long skirts? The Qatari ""Abaya""... please advise. appreciate it"
Q369_R40_C1 Good
Yes it's alright for men to wear short sleeve shirts.Like you said the more conservative;the better and that rule applies to men as well.As this is a conservative muslim country;total respect for local customs and traditions need to be observed.Women aren't advised to wear sleeve less shirts or tops as well as shorts.Business dress code is the same as anywhere else.For men formal suiting and for women nothing specific bit it has be decent so as not to offend anyone and more importantaly;to avoid any sort of unwanted attention.
Q369_R40_C2 Good
just for woman you can wear short sleeves and not above the knee length skirt or pants but the most important thing is your blouse should not reveal your .... when trying to pick up your grocery(as i've seen myself how the male cashier and other customers where staring at the woman with every procduct she tried to get from her trolly to the cashier)or if you have kids you have to follow or kneel for them ;so just something that will focus on your beauty in your face and anywhere else in the body;and good luck
Q369_R40_C3 Good
I agree with MR M;its not much to worry of your dress..its not an issue over here ;just be modest;even walking short (knee length)for ladies same with male is acceptable;but avoid showing to much affection with your husband while in public to avoid getting the attention of others.

Failure on second attempt would entail you to regist for a fresh ( qtr;half or full )course all over again.Pay a small tip to ur driver and he might teach you some special lessons on clearing the driving test.

Things to do before you begin drifting... . . . 1. Set up a cone in the middle of the lot. Drive up on the cone and rip the handbrake in an attempt to do a 180. Practice this until you are no more; and no less than 180 degrees from when you started. . . . . 2. Learn how to countersteer by ripping the handbrake from a speed of 10-20mph and trying to control the car to a destination until the car stops. . . . . 3. Increase speed of each of these things until you are comfortable. . . . . . 4. try to do the 180 cone turn but instead of stopping; hit the gas hard and power out and away from the cone. Start practicing this first and let me know when you are confident enough about this... “We make a living by what we get; we make a life by what we give.” Sir Winston Churchill

CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN WHY THIS PHOTOGRAPHER HAD TIME TO TAKE A PHOTO AND NOT HELP THE MAN?

Why is no one pulling the guy up?
Q371_R16_C4 Good
Because everyone seems to be busy clicking to post it somewhere like FB etc. I guess there must be a video footage also on youtube of about 5-10 minutes with some portions shot from a distance of say 1 ft or so and after a while we may hear it went viral and had millions of clicks in just a week or so.

britexpat... my comment is in the background of a molestation case (which I guess was even posted here sometime back when I wasnt active and used to only find time to read late in the nights) in India where the photos and videos were done by journalists and bystanders but none came forward to the rescue of the girl. And am sure there are many such cases elsewhere. A shameful picture of todays society indeed.
Q371_R16_C10 Good
This is what that sick photographer said in one of these statements. (“I just started running; running; hoping that the driver could see my flash) My question is; how does taking pictures tell a conductor to stop a train? Huh? What conductor would think; “Oh; look; someone’s taking pictures hmmmmm ;maybe I should stop the train!!!

Intercontinental Tent i think is the best... Very nice food; good sheesha and the entertainment is also good... Marriott wasnt that good; the food was nice but the sheesha was terrible as was the entertainment; small hall; no AC and very empty. Ritz Carlton.. Didnt go this year but last year it was amazing... Great Moroccan food; nice entertainment with dancers and live singers and the spinning egyptian man... great sheesha... I also heard that Diplomatic club is the best in Do7a but good luck trying to get a table; ive tried for soooo long and its always fully booked.. :)
Q371_R34_C7 Good
Ah; sorry Voyageress; bad wording on my part. They arrive on 28th so will experience a couple of days of Ramdan. I've heard good things about the InterCon one on the beach as well; but last year we went to InterCon one when it was inside and it was rubbish. Last two years we've been to Ritz-Carlton and it's been excellent; but it's expensive and we fancied a change.

If the batter is too thick add a little more milk. If it is too thin add a little more flour. Pass the batter through a strainer to remove all lumps. Lastly add the chopped cashewnuts and mix.

No one was injured in the latest attack in Orissa state; but police feared the arson will increase tension in a region with a history of violence along religious lines. Senior police official Gopal Chandra Nanda would not say whether the burned homes belonged to Hindus or Christians; but said an investigation was under way. The attacks took place in Tikabali; a town in Kandhamal district that has been the center of the unrest. Police have imposed a strict curfew across the district for the past week. The violence began late last month with the killing of a Hindu leader; which police blamed on Maoist rebels but Hindu activists blamed on Christian militants. In apparent retaliation; Hindu hard-liners set fire to a Christian orphanage; killing a Christian woman and seriously injuring a priest. Th.....

"INDIA Hindu Extremists ‘Motivate’ Christian Girl To Become A Missioner By T.S. Thomas December 17; 2008 BANGALORE; India (UCAN) -- Namrata Nayak’s face combines the trauma and the hope of the whole Christian community in Orissa state; eastern India. Methodist Bishop Sampath Kumar observed; ""Her burn scars have disappeared and there is a smile on her face; hope in her eyes. ”The prelate; who until he retired was presiding bishop of the Methodist Church’s Bangalore Episcopal Area; told UCA News the 10-year-old girl’s lively presence impressed him greatly. ""She did not complain about anything; nor did she show any vengeance toward anyone;” Bishop Kumar said. Instead; she came across as a “happy innocent child who wants to live for Jesus.” With another child and 24 widows; Namrata traveled 1;400 kilometers to Bangalore in southern India to attend an advance Christmas celebration for women widowed during the recent anti-Christian violence in Orissa.

Terrorism knows no race; colour; religion or creed. One mark of a nation to recognize the faults within it. We had terrorists in the IRA and the UFF. They were aligned to religion; but once we recognized and accepted this; we could address it. In a similar vein; both Hindus and Muslims; in India; Pakistan etc have to recognize that there are exteremists amongst them and work together to eradicate them..
Q372_R40_C5 Good
Terrorism knows no race; colour; religion or creed; but its main aim is to wipe out the human race and so we have to stand united to fight it and remove it from the root. Which is a very difficult task concerning the fact that every race; region has its own outlook on terror and wouldn't prefer others pointing at them. Look at what happened to war against terror witnessed in Iraq; Afghanistan etc. This is a big disaster and look at all the innocent blood stains; will they ever be wiped off? Whatever is done so far to remove terror is caused its evil head to reappear in another form. First the Muslim terrorist kills the Christians the Christians plot a way to tackle it calling it war against terror and creates terror in Muslims and the rest of the world; Muslims Terrorists killing the mostly tolerant Hindus causes Hindus to become Terrorists and this blame game continues. So the best way to tackle terror at present is to leave it to the world leaders. They will screw everything up for s.....

"Today is the International Day of Prayer For the Persecuted Church (IDOP). Who is the most persecuted group in the world? Christians. The official IDOP web site states: ""As a human rights issue; the persecution of Christians dwarfs all other forms of religious injustice. It is beneficial to take advocacy for fellow believers who suffer for their faith as a starting point; as Christians living in free societies have been largely unaware of or silent to this increasing tragedy."" I was just browsing the internet and came across this news story dated Nov. 8th. ""An evangelist in the North Indian state of Madhya Pradesh was killed by Hindu priests suspected of seeking human sacrifices for a Hindu ""goddess"" in the latest in a series of attacks against Christians in the country. According to the Global Council of Indian Christians; Vipin Mandloli; 27; was shot dead near Aamkut village in the Jhabua District; Madhya Pradesh."

Dont you think terrorist is a vague definition? who create them? what they want? Their agenda cannot be served through other peaceful means?

Why just this morning on my way into work; a qatari gentleman in a really nice car basically barged into me and we would have had quite a bad crash if i hadn't been polite enough to just stop and let him in rather than have most of my car side taken off by him. I think it's more a case of many problems on the roads of qatar taht really need to be taken care of!

Supermarkets - We look for Indian supermarkets to buy Indian spices and vegetables which are not available in other shops. Doctors - Most of the Indians look for Indian doctors because of either language and communication problems or they are not treated well (attitude). Even I have noticed Arabs prefer to go to Arabic speaking doctors so that they can communicate thier illness better. Restaurants - We prefer all different types of restaurants. However; we avoid going back to restaurants where we are not treated well. Regarding other communities; they have no choice as there are not many supermarkets and doctors from their country.

There is also many who will offer the service privately unregulated. Its your choice who you trust this small child with.

How much years of experience you have; normally for a design engineer with 12 to 15 years experience its a very good package; also what i had heard is qcon is a very good company. but you have to manage well with the egyptians over there..

Hello; I got a very similar offer and I rejected some months ago. Now; with a disaster global economy I would like to came back and have this opportunity again. With this offer I guess you could save 1.500 $ x month if your life style is not too expensive. Moreover; I was well impressed about quality of life in Doha (I love sea and sailing). The reason why I rejected was that I had to move very quick and I was scared of such a big change in my life and no time for fixing some business in my hometown. My suggestion is to accept and enjoy!

Q377_R11_C7 Good
Dear fellow; That's relative...Compare the offer with what you gettin now; I mean your current income. Similar to anywhere worldwide ; you can live on US$ 1000$ / month or your expensenses may reach as much as ten times (10;000 $)a month. In qatar; a family can decently live with 8000-10;000 QR /month + MIDDLE CLASS accomadation 8;000 QR + SCHOOLING 2000 qr a month . That makes around 20;000 QR in total. you may back-calculate any anticipated savings. As to the car; credit business help getting whatever car you may dream and that cost 2000-3000 QR /month for you to own a 2009 Model -luxuary car . Don't forget annual vacation; family airtickets and medical insurance costs.... Good Luck
Q377_R11_C8 Good
Considering the offer entirely depends on your profession..you should have mentioned that..only writing down experience is not enuf for a proper answer for eg: I would say this gross of 33k is amazing for a 10yrs experience Secretary..lol..but its not fine for a 10yrs experienced Chartered Accountact in a Central Bank or a Manager in very High profile Company! anyways;;coming to your savings...you can save alot..specially if you are taking your allowances rather than accomodation from company..for single/two; you will very good flat for half the price of ur allowance..also; you will save a lot from your basic..& even ur transport allowance will bring u savings.. all the best..& at this market situation..getting this offer is generous.... so grab it.!

Q377_R56_C5 Bad
Appreciate you guys-but my question is in two folds. Or I should take it that cost of living in Abu Dhabi is not as expensive as in Doha?
Q377_R56_C6 Good
my stay in Abu Dhabi was unforgettable and i would aways prefer it to Doha but frankly the present accommodatipon crises in Abu Dhabi has made life impossible for people who are new there. the rent are soaring but there is a severe shortage of accommodation and so even if u can afford the rent; u are unable to find anything vacant.the schooling problem is equally bad both in Doha as well as Abu dhabi
Q377_R56_C7 Good
I suggest Doha is the right place for U. When it comes the value of money same my friend but in Doha u can save a little than in Dubbbai...
Q377_R56_C8 PotentiallyUseful
Neither is acceptable !!!!! You need at least QR 45000.00 per month - I am serious okay! From a Brit on 27000.00 single status okay
Q377_R56_C9 Bad
The companies are not ready to pay more...does that implies rejecting the offer?
Q377_R56_C10 Good
Abu Dhabi is the best choice. This is true that these days it is difficult to find accommodation but if you ask your employer to provide you with the accommodation this will be the best solution. I am sure you will never regret the decision.Abu Dhabi has a future with so many real projects in pipeline and specially for a Quantity Surveyor with UK experience this job can be the base for other better opportunities. Good luck and go for it. Take my advise dont focus on present cost of living as these are highly volatile and misleading when I decided to come over in Doha April this year; it was based on good savings but in realty I found it other way round. I think when deciding about taking a job in Gulf; criteria these days should be better opportunity and quality of life and these two things no other city in Gulf provides except great Abu Dhabi.

Hi! I would immensely appreciate any good advice on service apartments/condos in West Bay area. Possibly; just walking distance or nearest to Doha Towers. What's the usual price range for this?

While I am preparing to take the PMP (Project Management Professional) certificate it popped up in my mind to drop this question to QL community. Did the PMP bring any added value to your career development? either by adding more professional skills to you or helped you to find a better/well paid job?
Q378_R22_C1 Good
A PMP certificate is not worth the paper it is printed on. Employers want experience; a construction/project management degree and evidence that you started a project and completed a project. I have reviewed many cv's and the majority of people with PMPs have simply not delivered projects; they have been involved; spent a long time ghetting all sorts of qualifications but when you ask them about the basics of project management their lack of practical; varied experience; shines through.

lol jonboy...I was thinking the same thing. But Im sure it depends on the individual; so I think I'll stick with it.
Q378_R22_C4 Good
In my opinion it is good. I've been working as a PM n doing reasonably well.. but on taking the PMP course; I discovered loads of information on how U can better do the job. That there is more to PM than the traditional ways adopted. Especially since its done in a structured n organised manner and in international terms which ppl fr all over can understand and identify with. Having the PMP will empower U to take on PM jobs more confidently. Of cos experience also counts. I am curious how these so called PMPs got their certificate if they cant even vouch for some basic experience. All depends on individual dedication. I wud say go for it. Good luck.

Q378_R29_C6 Good
my first trainset was also TOMY; that was 10years ago; which i handed over to my son which for now; only pieces of plastic tracks remains. i've got my first german model last year which is a starter set. i think its better that both you and your husband will be doing this hobby. What I am doing is that; i am the one who is in charge of the trains while my wife is the one who's constructing the models (stations; bridges; etc..). We're still waiting for the accessories that we need to construct our first diorama set (1200x600mm). try to go to miniatur wunderland website to check the largest modeltrain assembled.
Q378_R29_C7 Good
A few of the choices you need to answer before you get started are: What scale would you want to work with? What era or region of train type? How much space do you have for a layout? The two most popular scales are HO and N gauge; they would have the most accessories available for building a layout. With N gauge you could make a nice little layout on a desktop size area or smaller. With HO scale; you would need at least 2 desktop sized areas to make a small layout on.

When you go from Khalifa Stadium towards corniche; reach the firestation roundabout; take a right. You will get Athel;tes village on the right. Keep going straight and you pass a roundabout. Immediately after is an underpass. Dont go to the underpass; but take the road on the right of the underpass. You reach another roundabout. take a u-turn and come back and take the second right turn. You go directly onto the entrance of the bowling centre. Now about the price; It is the cheapest in the middle east. It is QR 10 for the first game and QR 8 for each subsequent games ( i am not sure about it). On Fridays and other weekends; you may have to book in advance. Its a lovely place with 32 international quality lanes. they have cafeteria and free internet access via wi-fi. Its a rockin place; though not many people know about it. For bookings etc; contact: Ph: 4353054; 4329132; 4329140 or 4329178. Their e-mail address is qatarbowlingcenter@gmail.com Whew; hope the info was useful. And like Mi.....

Soniya this is ridiculous rule . It is not the same in UAE or Oman or Bahrain or not even in KSA where i stayed alone for a couple of years . In Doha ; last summer -when my family was out of Qatar ; i was at office on friday and wanted to go to carrefour to buy something-villagio security blocked me . Ridiculous ; i m a serious buyer and needed to buy things . Then their head of security asked on cam -is the guy asian or british or european ; the nepali security guy replied asian sir ;immediately he said No ; block him . Stupid Rule .

Oh I see...so frustrating; anyway how about Thursday evening? (let say 6:00pm/7:00 pm) are we (bachelors) allowed/permitted to enter this mall?
Q380_R18_C6 Good
Fridays 10AM - 8PM no entry for bachelors in the malls. I have stayed in Saudi; and ofcourse they do not have such rules coz they are closed on any given day (except after 8pm or so). They too have family days; and even in the parks only families are allowed. Next; i have been to the malls all by myself and noone ever stopped me on a friday. Irrespective of what time i went. This rule is to keep those perverts away who have nothing better to do but stare at women during their free time!

Braids is not such a big problem. Once I spoke to a kenyan lady who works for Qatar Airways; and she said there are lots of girls who do it (not in a barber's shop; but at home). Finding out who can do braids is easy; just ask (or better let your wife ask) someone with nicely done braids; who did it for them The problem is that my wife wants to stop using braids and do hair relaxation; treatment etc. In other words a professional.
Q381_R6_C7 Bad
The rest is up to her - quite frankly; the less I have to do with it the better. My job is to notice and be seen to appreciate the final product whatever it is; and however she does it. That I cared enough to ask unprompted will keep me smiling (from the rewards) for weeks! :-)

The best hairdressers are at Riviera gardens; UK trained. However; sadly; I have given up on them because I live in Dukhan and can only go on Saturdays and they are so often off sick I can't get my appointment. If you take a midweek appointment you will be pleased with the result.

EJ in the Sheraton is where I always go to have my hair colored and cut. Roger is my hair dresser and he does a great job. I went from mid length hair to a very short cut...I love it! I highly recommend them. (The color/highlights I got are better than what I've gotten in my home town in the US.)

On a related note; my wife is wondering if any salons in Doha carry Sebastian hair products. Anyone seen these at your preferred salons? Thanks.
Q381_R19_C4 Good
"Do NOT go to Coiffure Francaise. I went in with very curly hair and asked Marie Claire; the hair dresser; to cut off ONE inch. She cut at least two inches off the overall length. I already had long layers and she asked me if I wanted layers and ended up cutting VERY short layers. She also cut the very front much shorter than the rest of my hair and then straightened the whole thing. I can not wear it curly because it looks REALLY bad. I have to spend extra time straightening my hair; and it's not growing quickly at all. I can't put it in a pony tail yet; and she cut it three weeks ago. If you see a girl around Doha that looks like she tried to give herself ""the Rachel"" at home; that's me. :("

Q382_R23
My husband availed a personal loan from Commercial Bank of Qatar but just now we have accessed his bank accounts through their website and we are really shocked to find out that aside from the monthly payment (which we have believed interest of 10.99% per annum has been included; they are also adding up some amount on monthly basis as well. Does anyone of you encounter the same thing with CBQ?
Q382_R23_C1 Bad
If you go to the Sharia court they will sue the bank for taking interest which is 'haram' in Islam. If not; well; then the Islam in Qatar is a farce.
Q382_R23_C2 Bad
Saeedkan; we just decided to pay the amount loaned in 2 years time (24 months) and we have paid already for 3 months but tonight only we were avail to sign up from their site as there was previous problem & we were really shocked to find out that on the 1st month; CBQ had debited almost 300QR; on the 2nd month: almost 350QR and last month: almost 400QR.
Q382_R23_C3 Good
the amount that they are adding is the interest per month on your outstanding amount; the annual interest whatever you have agreed they will calculate monthly and will add on to your outstanding balance; that is quiet normal nothing shocking or nothing unknown.
Q382_R23_C4 Good
hms is right; if you look at the statement you might see the monthly interest added on to the principal and the monthly installment as a deduction. If you have taken the loan in Variable interest rate option; the monthly addition will vary as they periodically adjust the interest rates.
Q382_R23_C5 Bad
CBQ sucks..Big time
Q382_R23_C6 Bad
Clearly you should be careful of the words that you use in a forum; because they can be easily taken out of context. By saying Islam in Qatar is a farce; are you attacking Islam; the Muslims; the people; the institutions...? The non-Muslim banks; and hotels that allow 2 of the biggest societal problems to occur have the blessing of the government... so whose problem is it; Islam's or the state's? And; although many think lightly of the 2 problems of Interest and Alcohol; society in Qatar ALL benefit from the laws that prevent alcohol consumption and their effects in public (if you doubt it; go to any UK city centre on Friday night). And those who think interest is not a problem; look at America and the foreclosure situation.
Q382_R23_C7 PotentiallyUseful
Thank you all for your insights and hope that my query will not create any conflict; argument or whatsoever to anyone of you. As my husband & I were formerly working in Abu Dhabi; UAE and had also experiences availing loans from 2 banks. One from his side on a fixed interest rate & on my side; on a floating interest rate (which I believe is just the same as variable interest rate). Both of which; we had no question about or might probably; from where I got my loan; they have different way of reflecting the added amount in my monthly statements or I was not given enough time to discover about that as I had to settle the loaned amount after just 2 months of availing it as we decided already to move here afterwards.

Q382_R23_C9 Bad

Q385_R30
I'm an Indian national; UK resident and top tier MBA with 6 years of exp ( 2 years GCC ); QF made me an offer 16500 base; 1200 transport; QF Housing. Is that good enough considering my exp and QF reputation ? (I obviously think it is not; just wanna get educated opinions :) Apart from this; leave;end of service;medical;car purchase etc is there. Any comments would immensely help.
Q385_R30_C1 Good
Considering your profile and experience; this is way way too less. You should get minimum 25;000 basic plus housing plus transport.
Q385_R30_C2 Good
Nope ...Guess u are under paid ... min is 25K
Q385_R30_C3 Good
Too low.. say NO
Q385_R30_C4 Good
QF has a standardized classification level that ties in with pay. The pay level depends upon the needs of the job; not on your qualifications. $25K QR plus benefits is actually a really high classification level; i think as a Senior Manager / Director type of position. $16;000 QR is more than many teachers make in Doha; so I would think that is probably a good salary; but again it depends on the job. The Housing and transport allowance makes up for any salary discrepancies you might encounter. QF is pretty fair about pay; and is an employer of choice in Qatar.
Q385_R30_C5 Bad
If that helps; I am supposed to report to the director of a department and whose salary I came to know would be in the range of 55-65K QR per month. I'd be the specialist and there would be a manager as well.
Q385_R30_C6 Good
This salary is too low considering your experience. I work in QF; and I know they have a tier system of salary; and probably you fall short from the next category by only a small percent. Try bargaining with them...the housing and health package is good..as far my opinion..
Q385_R30_C7 Bad
A rather foolish question; do you folks think that they would bargain ? Some Arab companies specifically don't; is QF one of them ? :)
Q385_R30_C8 Good
Is it better than you are making now? Is it a job you like and want to do? QF will pay for the job; not for your years of experience in another position. So; I'd say if you like the job; go for it. If it isn't enough money; wait until a job comes along in QF that more meets your credentials. Mandi
Q385_R30_C9 Bad
Orpheus80....they are flexible to bergaining....but not too much. It is worth trying.
Q385_R30_C10 Bad
Mandi; as always i agree with you. It depends on your position; not on your years of experience or education. If one with MBA and 10 years of experience as a top manager one day accepts an Office Boy job; he cannot expect manager's salary.

I went shopping to Carrefour and I couldn't find any of the Al Marai products. I actually like this brand the most; when it comes to juices; milk; yoghurts...but I couldn't find any of them in there anymore. Anyone has any idea what happened? Why Carrefour doesn't have them anymore?

Don't know. the last time i went there they told me they had the almarai products removed...wouldn't tell me why...so i'll just make it up... the managers got into a fight _______________________________________________________________ One of the hardest things for us to do in our human nature is to just stop what we are doing to allow God to produce in us what only He can produce.

almarai products avaialable at the local groceries
Q386_R10_C3 Good
As a result many brands sometimes appear like they've been removed completely until they get around to restocking them.....which takes WAY too long for some reason. If there's something specific I need; I usually check out Giant or Family Food Center; and most of the time one of them will have it. Hope that helps. Stay safe.  Perfection does not exist. The question therefore; is: what level of imperfection are we willing to settle for?
Q386_R10_C4 Bad
Anjas; i said Carrefour...  Ragnarock; i know what u mean; but it is just weird that all the products from this brand were suddenly not available... so i don't think it was the issue of stocking up. and as Fembot said; they won't say why those products are no longer available. If you're looking for a problem; you're probably gonna find one.
Q386_R10_C5 PotentiallyUseful
But like I said with other brands (though maybe with not as WIDE a range of products) they have gone missing for a LONG time then suddenly showed up....so we are forced to do the stockpiling thing when they ARE available LOL...sad; but this is how its done here if you want to ensure you don't run out of the brands you like. The best advice I can give you is ask to speak to a manager (in the admininstration department; not just a floor section manager in the store) next time you are there; and inquire about the brand specifically. And IF for some reason they did stop carrying it; you should be able to find them in other stores (unless the whole country decides to ban them for whatever reason). Hope that helps. Stay safe. Perfection does not exist. The question therefore; is: what level of imperfection are we willing to settle for?

it was the Mall in Old Airport area build first. ppl used to go to THE CENTER near Ramada for shopping mostly the westerners.Than Landmark came up and City center and so on. [img_assist|nid=13339|title=.|desc=|link=none|align=left|width=180|height=180]

"You must also remember what was originally on the site of the Mall in the old arport area. That massive and squalid shanty town. The Center was the only decent large shop and it had BHS as one of its franchises although many of the items for sale were not BHS products; just BHS labels sewn on in the wrong place. There was a Shwarma stall in the car park and a cafe inside that served many dishes. Both were operated by ""The Caravan"". The only other shop of any size was Salam Studios; on Al-Saad Street. Now the site of the QP offices and HSBC. Salam Plaza didn't open until the early/mid 80's I seem to recollect. If there was something that you wanted and couldn't find; Globe China was the place to go."

Q387_R41_C5 Good
There was no life without the Malls earlier; but i should say people used to spend more time at home getting together with friends or family... Like every said it was only center and then the mall in the late nineties ... But things have changed a lot since city center and the other malls have opened up ....

Globe China I don't know if it still exists. Location wise: Up from the Sofitel towards Rayyan Road somewhere down a little narrow street on the left. Cannot remember which street but it was past the one that had an Olympic Sports branch near the corner.

...that is a really good question. I've often wondered exactly the same thing but I've never gotten around to asking it. I would love to know more about what life was like before the malls but also before Doha was the chaotic city it is now.

growing up I don't remember any traffic jams!!! Life was calm and peaceful...I do remember going with my Mum to the souq for shopping (spices; perfumes; material for clothing; nuts; etc) Now they deliver to us! But we still go once in a while. I remember going to Europe a few times a year (staying in our houses in London and Paris and travelling around) and we would always have a long list of things to buy and take back. Clothes; shoes; medicines; foodstuffs...endless list. Now the list is shorter as there is so much more available to buy in Doha and online buying with shipping is easier. Some of my older relatives remember Doha as a walled city with a curfew at night. Someone came along to light the gaslamps (?) at sunset and during Ramadan someone came through the streets at Suhoor time to wake everyone up to eat before the fasting began for the day. Dweller; you've got a good memory...I had forgotten about Salam Studios on Al Sadd St. My Dad used to shop there a lot. I remember when.....
Q387_R41_C10 Bad
and what are salam studios exactly?
Q387_R44
I know I can find this information elsewhere; I just thought I would ask on here first just incase someone can save me the trouble of looking it up myself.
