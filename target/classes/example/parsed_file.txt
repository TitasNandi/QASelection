silly guy.. but here you go... exfoliate(about 2 times a week); using a mild scrub..try to get the ones that have microbeads in them...anything else will cause microscopic cuts in your skin.. clean with a mild cleanser twice a day avoid doing things that rub dirt and oils into your skin..such as sitting with your hand on your chin..phones up against your face..etc.. get facials...

First ask him to take hot water shower. Wrap hot towel on and around the place of pain. It will be soothing... Boil water with garlic and let him inhale the vapours.It will give relaxation.

Guys; all of you are advising him for mild migraine. Severe migraine is very very difficult. He needs not only relief from current episode but also need to get medicine to prevent future attacks. Consult a good doctor and ask about treatment and prevention in detail. Most the most important thing; try to find out what triggers your migraine attack (if possible) and avoid it as much as you can.
Q1_R43_C5 Good
I suffer from migranes and the only thing that helps is Sumatriptan. The medication is called Apigrane; the box has 2 capsules. Take one on a full stomach and go to sleep. Drink plenty of water before and after taking the capsule. You will have a strange feeling in your stomach but you will be migranefree when you wake up. I hope you feel better soon; I know and feel for your pain as I get it very often too :(

Thanks to you guys :); how long it will take to process RP? I have all the docs needed. Coz I want it all done within tourist visa period of 30 days.
Q2_R20_C4 Good
Hi Peylenzkie. If my info is not mistaken; you have to apply for RP 1st which takes 10 days or more; then after that; you need to apply your 1 wife to 1 year Family Visit Visa (spouse) which takes 10 days; then convert her Tourist visa to Family Visit Visa (needs Attested Marriage certificate) which takes 3 days. Then lastly; apply for her RP (10 days). So my advice; finish your RP first then apply for their RP later. Tourist visa is 30 days only; not extendable so they have to go out the country.
Q2_R20_C5 Good
Please note after getting your RP you need NOC from hotel/sponsor of tourist visa for converting a tourist visa to family visit visa. This document is must.
Q2_R20_C6 Good

Thanks for the very informative comments and advice guys @newexpatqatat; @mary-vani; crispycrisp & rm123
Q2_R20_C10 PotentiallyUseful
I would suggest not to bring your family unless u get ur RP done. Because 1s their tourist visa is expired and you don;t have family visa they won't be able to come back to Doha for next 3 months (explained by the Visa incharge in the company of my husband ). And your RP would take approx. 7 months as they need your salary statement for 6 months which you'll get only when you have a bank account. After you complete your 6 months salary statement from bank; you need Rent agreement; your educational certificates needs to be attested by your country embassy and Doha embassy (you can do this within those 6 months also); you need to clear fingerprints and medical tests and then you'll get your RP & QID. After that you can bring them on tourist visa on your sponsorship which can be extended for upto 6 months (as it was a year ago. Might have changed now) unless you get your family visa and their RPs & QIDs. Working out for their RPs & QIDs will be much easier than yours. All the Best.

you can also extend your tourist visa but very costly as compared with extending a family visit visa. maybe what you can do is exit from qatar then; after three months; apply again for a family visit visa (if you have a relative here)
Q2_R21_C8 Good
you can extend a family visit visa for a maximum six months; but in any case that you have to extend it again after your 6 months limit; you can do that; too. i think upto 1 month; more. you just have to submit application form again to immigration with your flight booking details.

you guys are mixing Family visit visa and Tourist visit visa. Family visit visa (when you were sponsored by one of your family member)initially is valid for 1 month; and can be extended later for another 5 months (total 6 months stay) after undergoing Medical examination. Tourist visit visa is is valid for 30 days and can be extended for another 30 days ; 60 days stay in total.

My visa is expiring real soon (completed 6th months). Can my husband re-apply for a family visit visa while I exit in near country like UAE; waiting for my visa to process?

Q2_R32_C1 Good
Yes;Your husband can apply for you the next moment you exited from qatar; No matter where you travel; the normal visa processing time is 3 working days; after that you can come back with new visa.
Q2_R32_C2 Good
You must need 3 months to stay out from qatar; your husband can only apply after 3 months. I tried several times but they refused and saoid come back when three months complete. However you can stay here more than 6 months; your husband can go to immigration and talk with captain he will extend one month more; some time more than one month.Good Luck

My question is; can I still extend her visa for another (1)one month? Please help and advice! Thank you!

Yes you can extend till another 3 months to complete 6 Months as a total since she arrives in Qatar.
Q2_R46_C2 Good
Yes you can extend her visa for another 3 months to complete 6 months since she arrives in Qatar .
Q2_R46_C3 Good
The above information is not correct. 6 Months Visit visa is only for your direct relatives(blood Relation) if its your wife's relative then its only 3 months; and if you go request for 1 more month showing a ticket they might grant you.
Q2_R46_C4 Bad
May be its a new rule as I had no problem at all to renew for my in laws or niece / nephew .
Q2_R46_C5 Good
It is correct. 3 mnths for indirect relation and later a month extension after showing a ticket. Go to the Main Immigration.
Q2_R46_C6 Good
This NOT new rule it indeed old rules. niece or nephew is consider as direct relatives but sister in law is falls under indirect relatives of yours as she is the sister of your wife. @sms09...you are correct.! anyhow you can still extend her visa of 1 month provided air ticket to the immigration officer; without ticket then sorry to say...no EXTENSION..

Do medical test by second week of this month or week before ur visa expire....

My sponsor; who is my brother; recently applied for a visit visa extension for me. It was approved and I was extended for another 4 months.

there should be small white sticker attached in your passport that has the date of entry to Doha and the expiry date (or your visa extention date). so that incase police checks the validity of your stay in Doha; it will be easier. better visit immigration office in madinat khalifa to validate the authenticity for your own safety.

"Zouheirn; don't stir a sh*t! Single entry visas for ALL ""passports"". Don't say nonsense.. Why out of ALL nationalities the exception would be made only for UK? Citizens of 34 western countries can obtain a visa upon arrival; without prior application; but more or less the same rule applies to the entire world; not only in Qatar. ravi.shock; in order to obtain a visit visa (only Single entry; like everyone!); you have to have relatives here; who can sponsor you. They should know the requirements. Otherwise you can apply through the Hotel."

To sound like a expert . I know for a fact there are only 33 countries that can get upon arrival visit visa Americans are one; it is renewal for 1extra month. Then you must leave Qatar and re enter on new visa. I have been here 10 months; there is no multiple entry visa for Qatar.

No; your company has to get an NOC letter drawn up in the name of your bother that they are willing to take you under their sponsorship; your brother needs to sign that and give your company; from there on you are their responsibility.

unless ur visa is not printed on passport; u can easily change a sposor (NO NEED OF NOC). Many people do not know this procedure and stick with the job.

why is that so? business visa is good as visit visa right? as long as I have exit stamp with my business visa on that 3 month grace period; I guess there will be no problem if I go back to my country and look again for another employer who will possibly give me a working visa. NOC is only applicable if you had a working visa I supposed.
Q3_R68_C3 Good
brattykharz u are absolutely right. U can apply for a job. And if u find an employer they will process ur visa from business to work visa. U only need NOC if u want to transfer to another employer after one year service to ur 1st employer.

I am looking at the situation of discontinuing my employment with my current employer now. So I advised them not to convert my business to working visa. I wanted to go home instead. What I'm afraid of is that; maybe I will be banned and can't enter again Qatar in 2yrs if I don't have an NOC from my previous sponsor. What do you think?
Q3_R68_C5 Good
if your current employer didn't transfer your business visa to working visa then u still had a chance to discontinue the work and exit Doha. You just need to have an exit permit from the sponsor of business visa. But if you already had a medical from your current employer then it means that they already applied the change of your visa even if the RP card is not yet given to you and you will be ban for 2 years if you exit Doha. Mostly companies here are not giving NOC; so think twice before you decide.

really? even if the FP is not done? you'll be banned? when was that happen?

so far there was no advice for me to do the medical. they said they are giving a 3 month period for my probation which was equal to do length of my business visa. i still have up to next month to finally decide. as long as Im still in business visa; nothing to worry about the future.right?

I'm outside of Qatar for 5 months now; I filed a resignation to my company but they did not allow me. I had to take an emergency leave because of some issues in my homeland. I'm aware that the visa/rp will be cancelled after 6 months of being outside the country but can my employer file an absconding case against me on the ground of non-returning from emergency leave?
Q3_R77_C1 Good

No; I do not have any outstanding loans or credit cards in Qatar.

on whom sponsorship are you; husband or company?if you are on husband sponsorship; there is nothing to worry about; he needs to apply for extension for your stay outside qatar post 6 months.but you can return without any hassles. if you are on company sponsorship; then its not so simple.
Q3_R77_C9 Bad
Phsb; Yes I got an exit permit and now in India. I was told by our company secretary that they plan to file an absconding case against me because I did not return from my emergency leave to which I intended to resign earlier because of some personals issues; had they accepted my resignation. t_coffee; thank you for the responses. Han19; I was on a company sponsorship during my stay in qatar.
Q3_R77_C10 Good
MM; you have been on a long emergency leave; normally a leave would be for one month; did you officially request your company that they extend your leave to cover this 5 month period that you have been out of the country or has it been absence without permission. do you have email communications etc supporting your request. hope you have a copy of the resignation letter that you had sent to them and the rejection. i am not sure about the rules applicable for a company sponsored individual to come on husband sponsor within the year.

My profession shown in my residence visa is Technician whereas in reality I am working as Manager. I tried to change my profession from Technician to Manager through our agent but for some reason he is saying it is not possible. I have Masters in Business administration and Masters in Geology.

you can do it on your visa renewal... just submit your certificates/diplomas; they have to change it for you. unless the company doesn't have a visa for the certain positions/nationals.. coz before issuing visa on particular name; company has to get an aproval for the certain nationality and position; and then they apply your name to this visa...

It is important; getting an NOC from sponser. First get the Application Form for Profession Change; get your sponser sign & seal on that paper then goto Labour Dept(near to American Hosp) along with; 1) Sponser ID copy 2) Munciplaity Bill 3) Edu. Qual Copy (should be Transalted) 4) Bank Stmt(6 months) 5) Aggriment Contract (3 New) (newly printed) 6) Aggriment Contract (3 Old - Already signed) 7) Your PP ; Visa and ID copy. Submit this and get sign from officer he is sitting in 3rd Floor. Once you got the sign goto the nearest office for attestaion of your contracts.( new 3). while attestation you have to pay 50 QR. wait for another 10 days and got Immigration office(garaffa) and show your receipt from Labour by showing them the New Application for ID change with your photo. Then go Buiding no: 1 and submit your application there; you have to pay 300 QR. On the spot you will get your new ID and Visa sticker on your PP. Go Ahead good luck for you. I just changed recently.
Q3_R79_C9 Bad
What's the big fuss of changing your position on your VISA? Can you even READ what is written on your PATAQA? Do you go around with; showing everyone your LABOR CONTRACT where it states that you are MANAGER? Does anybody around you care whether you are Manager or not on your VISA? I can't even seem to find the benefit of changing the title; not unless you want to brag around everyone saying 'I've got a Manager's title on my VISA'. I am an ENGINEER without a MASTERS degree; but my title is ELECTRICIAN. What's the BIG DEAL? It's not because things are difficult that we don't dare; it's because we don't dare that makes things difficult!

Hai guys I have been working in qatar since 1995 in a reputed company as a supervisor. The title of my visa was labor.As uyou said it doesn't make any difference until I try to bring my family here; Because we are not able to bring our family if our visa in such title even we are working as a manager ; I canceled my RP while I go on vacation and cameback in new visa as engineer. I heard that even we we can visit UAE for 7 days if we had a engineer or doctor visa (not sure).

Q4_R8_C2 Good
the RP ID (together with your passport) should be submitted to the Immigration to cancel it. HOWEVER ; THEY(your sponsor) can report you to the CID as absconding/absconded to release them of any responsibility of you. When they get that clearance from the authorities; they will no longer issue you an NOC letter; and may even report your whereabouts to the police and have you deported. That would be the worst scenario. This happened to someone I know 2 years ago. I'm not sure if the procedure changed.

Thank you so much Anna ; Rizks and Babesphil... that's what my friend is going to do. He will be leaving in the Philippines for Hongkong for a tour purpose. He will be staying there for 3 days to consume his tour package. After 3 days he will be taking a flight to Doha. My follow-up question is that; is it convenient to just purchase a ticket there in Hongkong bound for Doha since it's cheaper I guess or I'll just buy for him a ticket here where I purchased his tourist visa? And is it just ok if it's only a one way ticket (Hongkong-Doha)? Will the Hongkong immigration scrutinize this one way ticket? So sorry for asking too much as my friend is really worried same as me.

Winnie Park House has currently closed its waiting list for all years. I have two children at PHES and so far have been pleased. One is in year 10 and hates the uniform; the school the teachers..... I think he is settling in nicely. We had to wait until last week (end of Sept) to get a place for my daughter in reception year. But the facilities in the primary section are good. The class rooms are bright airey clean and inviting. They have canopyed areas for the children to play outside. The school is small (about 600 including secondary); but they are currently building further extensions for sixth form. They moved into these premises over a year ago. All the teachers I have met are enthusiastic and bubbly. The head teacher Mrs Brennan is very approachable and ameniable. They have a very pragmatic approach to education and have adopted the British healthy schools policy. There is no canteen so its invent as many ways as possible to make a sandwiche look interesting for the next 10 year.....

I was just this morning talking to a colleague who has two kids at Park House as I am considering sending my own daughter there. The feedback is very positive. Good facilities (they have now got their new place and are no longer using the Russian Embassy building). Apparently the teachers are very kind but also exert a strong sense of discipline and manners (cell phones are not allowed). They have recently started offering the International Baccalaureate. Everything I have heard about Park House has been very positive.

Thanks very much you have really put my mind at ease. I currently work for Education here in the UK - it appears your approach to Qatar is much the same as mine - giving up the housework etc... and as for getting trim again I am also going to enrol in some slow toning classes! Did you find it easy to make friends in Doha. My husband has been there a week and could not even get to the beach on Friday as it was members only. Any suggestions for a place he can relax on his day off? He is waiting for us to get there to join clubs etc... Appreciate your help.
Q4_R14_C5 Bad
My husband came over by himself and he found the first week awful. He nearly came home several times. If your husband likes a drink he could try Garveys or the Rugby club. Alot of british use these. I believe you have to join as a member or come with someone as a guest. Tell him to buy a copy of the Marhaba in Carrefours supermarket in City Centre. that lists all events happening in Q and where to go. It is updated every season. It is also available at Jarirs bookstore. What co. does your husband work for?
Q4_R14_C6 Bad
I have emailed you directly as I am sure there is more knowledge you can share with me. Do you live in a villa or apartment. Our company has provided us with a new 3 bed apartment and I do not know what it will be like with a 7yr old; he is used to playing out on his bike etc... I suppose as I will not be working I will have to keep him occupied - any good places for children to play/met etc.. We already have a copy of Marhaba which has been useful. I think Ramadan is the biggest problem at the moment. My husband has a company vehicle but I think I will have to get a car to do the school runs etc.. do you think I could hire one initially? or lease? Who does your husband work for. My husband is working very long hours at the moment as they are so busy - keeps him out of mischief I suppose!

Hi guys I couldt help myself but this topic has caught my attention; reason being is that we have an appointment with PHES school this week to enrol my two sons; im guessing one will be year 6 and the other year 8; from what ive heard about the school it has a really good reputaion and just been new to doha now 3 weeks werve been told that there are now spaces available; we did try doha but no luck there not until next year; so it will be interesting to see what happens; didnt realise getting your kids into a school in qatar would be more difficult than getting a job anywhwere in the country.

First of all;find out the exact reasons for this behaviour.Try to find out his likes and dislikes.His areas of interest. Once this is done;see if Qatar can match his life style.Please donot make any false promises(even unknowingly) because this can worsen the situation. As soon as you reach here;make it an exciting experience for him.May be taking hium around to places he would like to visit or things he would like to do will help.

My mom's friends have kids between the ages of 14-16. Their parents don't let them do much because they can't really do anything here aside from school; mall; and swimming parties in compounds. And from coping with the behavior? Not moving to Qatar will help. He's in his teen years and he's probably into doing senseless things (like when we were at that period in our lives); so.. you might want to have a second thought. But then again; he's a guy.. so; it's much better than having to drag a teen daughter to the middle east.

"Bribe him. Am not saying cheat him. You can promise him somethings that he like if he comes to Doha. Do not know what he might find in Qatar tempting for him. This is the only way.

Turns out even my marriage certificate was not good enough as we got a knock on the door at 11.00pm and told to leave the hotel .. they said I did not have a ministry stamp on my marriage certificate; nor did I have a LETTER OF PERMISSION from my husband. I was so angry .... I got the man to ring my husband; but that wasn't good enough either .. this was when they said I needed the ministry's stamp on my marriage certificate!!!!!!

Hi. Does anyone know of any English speaking middle/high school with a boarding facility in Qatar? If not; is there anyone who has a child/children in a boarding school elsewhere? In what country? Any information will be very much appreciated! Thank you!

Hi mama-e Our son went to Darlington School in Rome; GA. It is a wonderful boarding school but it high school only. Friends of ours sent their son to one in Massachusetts; I'm sorry I cannot remember the name. He was in 7th grade when he went. I think it was Eagle something - sorry senelity really sucks. I don't think there are many in the US that offer boarding for Middle School. Best of luck.

If you have a use it or lose it kind of deal with your relocation allowance bring as much as you can. You won't have to spend as much on setup when you get here. Bringing your favourite stuff will make it seem more like home here. Bringing a car is probably not a good idea.
Q5_R3_C2 Good
That's the thing Margaret; I've been offered a reasonable shipping allowance. It seems such a waste though (financially and moreover environmentally); to ship the basic practical stuff. I'm not particularly attached to 'things' in any event. My most favourite things are my friends and my memories. I can't ship my friends over in a tea-chest; although some may come to visit; and my memories are mostly in my head; although some are also recorded in photo form; and I wouldn't want to entrust my most dearly loved photos to a shipping company. I've never been particularly materialistic and so my favourite 'stuff' amounts to a few trinkets and things bought on my travels; shoes (but I'm going to limit myself as to how many pairs I bring over; because I want to -- and can -- travel light). I particularly like a lamp; a few pictures and paintings; my Le Creuset pans (although they are so stupidly heavy I wouldn't dream of shipping them half way across the world).

Blankets. During the UK summer I find even the lightest duvet is too warm and I prefer to use a cotton waffle blanket. Friends who had lived in the middle east advised me that with the air-conditioning I would need a duvet here. They were wrong. We keep our air-co at 25 degrees and I miss my blanket. I can't find cotton waffle blankets here; only nasty fleece ones. The choice of duvet covers isn't too good either - too expensive or too tacky - especially since bhs went up in smoke. It got pretty cold in the winter. Bring an electric fire. Plastic food containers are generally of poor quality and you need to keep dry food sealed up or the bugs will get in.
Q5_R3_C6 Bad
Thank you for your suggestions so far; they're really useful. @ The truth: I was planning on bringing as little as possible anyway; but I wouldn't have thought about a Skype phone (thanks the truth). @ charmed: Luckily; charmed; I don't have a dog; I did have a cat but I had to re-home her about two years ago when I went to France for a few months. And the length of time it takes to clear stuff is the other problem. Even if I did want to ship some practical household items; I would surely have bought some replacements by the time my own were shipped and cleared customs! @ Squarepeg: Blankets -- that's an interesting point; squarepeg; I mostly have duvets and throws at home; but I might get some blankets. Do the a/c units work as heaters too? I recall that when I lived overseas before; the a/c units also worked as heaters; do they have similar units in Doha?

I didn't see many bugs; so I stored some dried food in plastic bags with the tops rolled over. I was in the UK for a couple of months in the summer and when came back I found weevils in the flour; rice etc. I threw it away and invested in some plastic containers with good seals. Haven't noticed any bugs in the kitchen since. To be honest; I've had more problems with ants in the UK than I've had with bugs here. Here; we have a bug man who comes and sprays around the house onece a month. There's an earlier thread on this subject somewhere in the archives; I think. I think I'm right in saying that a/c units here generally don't also work as heaters. Certainly in our house they just cool.

The cost of living here is cheap! Although when we talk about rentals for apartments/villas/flats it is expensive. Grocery items are priced reasonably and is affordable and worth. Eating at restaurants more than once a week is fine (restaurants that are not fine dine). Clothing. There are many store here to choose your clothes from. There are many stores inside the shopping mall that is more often than not that sell on sale. Cosmetics. Well I'm a boy and so I don't know much about these but I see most women here wear make up always so I think the price is tolerable. Obviously the prices of oil and gas here is cheap. So overall; living here in Doha is cheap.

"I agree 100% with Ralph; the 1st post. Housing is very expensive; although it's coming down very fast. I just signed a lease on a villa for 10500QR/mth(~$2900USD). It's brand new; 2 stories; 4 beds; 3 1/2 baths; huge rear patio; covered parking; pool; clubhouse; close to Villagio Mall. You can get furnished 2-3 bed apts for 6500-9000Qr/mth (~$1800+) all over the place nowadays. Groceries are cheap for the most part. Only certain ; select items are really expensive. Petrol is practically free here. Utilities (if you have to pay them at all) are very cheap. The best place to buy clothing is on the internet or wait for a sale in the mall stores. Other household items and appliances are very reasonably priced as well. As someone mentioned; it really depends on your income and usual standard of living.

mr. qatar-engineer seems more like the salesman at Strong rent a car. Anyway; Qatar is one of the most expensive countries to live in. Agreed; this is not the case if your housing; schooling; etc are paid. But groceries are obv much more expensive than every country I have been to (except Japan).

Just wondering if it's worth shipping the kids bikes; skateboards; xbox360 etc over with our other personal effects from New Zealand? What have others done? Cheers!
Q5_R48_C1 Good
No worries; All you need to do is assess how much it would cost to bring your stuff down. Then compare it with purchasing the same from Qatar.
Q5_R48_C2 Good
My suggestion is that if you can fit toys in with your other effects without huge expense then anything you can bring that will keep them entertained here is a good thing - and will save you time and effort trying to duplicate it all after you arrive. Actually your children probably won't want to spend much time on their bikes and skateboards during the hot summer months here; and depending on where you will be living; it might be difficult to find somewhere in your neighbourhood for them to ride around safely too. By the way; while you're packing; I would be tucking a big jar of vegemite into a spare corner (if your kids like it) as it is very hard to find here and the few 150gm jars I have ever seen here cost a bomb! Hope this helps.
Q5_R48_C3 Good
It largely depends where you will live. If you are on a compound; many kids ride their bikes & skateboards inside the compounds. The electronic items; I would definitely bring because they will be much more expensive here. Good Luck with your move.
Q5_R48_C4 Bad
basically the kids (12 and 8) brought a few special toys etc with them and we purchased other items ie bikes etc once we arrived. We purchased a Wii here for less than it would've cost in NZ but you have to be careful that if you bring your own PS and buy disks here that they are compatible. Likewise if you buy a new PS here that it is compatible with what is sold back in NZ; Virgin sells PAL. We didn't ship anything as we didn't know how long we would be here for and only came with suitcases and paid the excess baggage charges. Looks like we may be heading out sometime this year anyway and I'm so pleased that we didn't go the full hog and ship everything over.

I wish we'd brought more stuff with us when we came from NZ last year; don't have any advice re kids stuff but here's what I wish I'd known. *Bring cushion covers; knick-knacks; throws; and art; the furniture selection here is dismal but even worse is trying to find the little things. Depending on your taste you may be ok but if for example you like really simple contemporary things you're out of luck. We struggled to find things like a plain shower curtain; or a plain white dinner set. definitely bring cutlery! *Don't bring Duvet covers; the duvets here are sized differently and won't fit them. You probably won't need to bring sheets either (you'll end up with a king or super king bed) *Bring books (incl kids books) there are no good bookshops here *Bring a box of bits and pieces; things like craft knife; quick-unpick; tape; tapemeasure; vivids...etc you can buy all these things here but not necc at the same shop; I bought a box of random office stuff and I'm so glad i did! *If you br.....

If you have a generous shipping allowance; ship everything that matters to you and especially to your children. If you have special hobbies; ship any tools or items specific to that hobby - for example; quilters cannot buy batting in Qatar; or only rarely. Many children's toys are available very cheaply in Qatar; made in China; many break quickly or don't work properly. If you will live on a compound; a bike is a fun thing to have; but biking on the streets in Qatar is a hair-raising and life-threatening experience. Bring books. Bring anything that will make your life more homey and that will bring you comfort. Bring things you love but can leave behind or sell when leaving Qatar; knowing you can replace them back home. As Emma said; you can buy just about anything; but you may not like your choices. There is a lot of cheap - and ugly - stuff available; but quality is rare and may be priced two or three times higher than at home. On the other hand; there are European appliances which s.....

I totally agree with EmmaS and Intlxpatr. I'm sooo glad we brought a huge stock of kids' books and toys - it was definitely worth it.
Q5_R48_C8 Good
Yes - bring as much stuff as you can for the kids. Bring shoes for yourself - sandals - shoe shopping no that great here. Go to Briscoes for super king sheets and king size single sheets. One of the most important things to get; unless you actually enjoy sleeping on a concrete slab; is a mattress topper - like a foam/latex pad to go directly on top of your matresses. I suffered for a few months before managing to find one here but it took a bit of hassle and homework first. Bring one if you can so that you have it straight away. We didn't bring a vacuum cleaner and find we don't need one; the tiled floors get swept and mopped.Lots of my daughter's dvds don;t work here - wrong zone. Our tv worked here - bring yours if want to.
Q5_R48_C9 Good
we are constantly having to order and ship things over from NZ; the UK; the US as they are not available here. We end up paying way too much in shipping charges but you just cannot get the products here of the appropriate quality and any time you are looking for something specific you can never find it as the choice is extremely limited. Just recently it was toddler car seats and only today we have ordered a wooden playpen online from NZ to ship here as we cannot find a lightweight one in Qatar. We are constantly getting our family to buy and send us baby products from NZ which we cannot get here. So definitely bring whatever you can including medicines; homeopathic remedies if you use them (as they are not available at all here); skin care treatments etc. You can always sell old toys/things once the kids grow out of them or before you leave again - particularly if they are good quality items!

also; as other posts have recommended; bring kitchen items; crockery etc too. We did not bring our everyday dinner set and spent ages trying to find something that was dishwasher and microwave safe.

Actually Mila I would have to disagree with you. As a native Canadian I can attest that the job market is saturated with educated professionals. What they lack is service people and people to work the oil rigs. So; yes if you want to flip burgers for your whole life or work on a rig there are plenty of jobs. If however you're a professional such as myself; getting a decent job is difficult; especially since most of the jobs are already taken by baby boomers refusing to retire.

Hi there! Exciting isn't it? We are coming from New Zealand although we are poms. This is supposed to be a stop off on the way back to the UK. I'm going to teach Technology.

Q5_R55_C5 Bad
Hi Mel; I guess most of the stuff that I have learned so far about AKIS and Qatar is probably the same as you. Actually finding out stuff seems difficult compared to most things on the internet. Lots of stuff seems to be out of date and this forum seems mostly full of people that struggle to put a sentence together (for whatever reason). We have found NZ to be an interesting experience but we miss our family and friends and financially we have been worse off. Food is especially expensive here; so it is good to find it cheaper there. I have been told that because the restaurants in the community are subsidised you can eat well for a couple of dollars! The school seems to have the same 'politics' issues of any school; so I guess it all depends on who you end up being mates with as to how bearable it is. Where in the UK is your husband from and what prompted the move? If you want to use email rather than this hopeless website my address is evansfamilynz@xtra.co.nz Found anyone else going .....

I found that quite interesting. Do you have any kids? Will your wife be working too? Do you know what the child care options are? My husband was born in Ireland but grew up in Coventry and has been here for 4 years. We have been talking for ages about working overseas and thought we would just give it a go and see if anything came up. The Middle East sounded good from a tax free point of view and also because it was only one flight away from the UK. We plan to visit our relatives there quite often. Mel :)
Q5_R55_C7 Good
Hi Mel; yes I saw that posting about the teachers all heading out on the same flight. I imagine there are just as many this year but I guess they haven't found this thread/found this website/want to remain anonymous! We have 2 kids; both boys (13 & 9); we haven't told them yet; that is a job for this holiday. Not quite sure what their reaction will be but I am sure they will be pleased to be closer to their family. We have booked flights to the UK at the end of July and will be spending 5 weeks there before getting the plane to Doha. Gill is trained as a junior teacher but hasn't done that for a while. I think she is hoping to get something in the school once we get there; I'm sure it makes more financial sense for them to employ people who are already there; we'll see.

Qatar labor law is made to protect the interest of Expats working in Qatar.min you can get 21 days vacation per year & 21 days gratuity per year of year worked.min should be one year of service.

"You're required to provide 1 month notice before you resign so you called get all your benefits. I think at least 75% of your salary x years of service is your gratuity plus all your vacation leave & etc; Im not sure though but most probably it's going to be like that... I have a question my self & it is related here though I already posted it to questions & answers but it seems no one is really visiting that part of QL so... My company got this habit of delaying people from the date of resignation so they obviously knows about the two weeks max limit of Qatar labor code's article 57. My question would be; is there a law regarding my company being liable or giving me a just compensation starting from the day I terminated my contract to the day I go back to my home country if they ""accidentally"" delays me for one or two days up?"
Q6_R3_C4 Good
every company is liable to give 21 days annual vacation and 21 days indemnity/gratuity minimum upon completion of one year. some companies to avoid this terminate the staff in 11 months. and others mostly dont pay anything to the ignorant labors and junior staff that they dont get their rights. you can approach the Human rights department and the labor department who help the expat in such cases. @ cupid-s_victim: any resignation or termination should serve a months notice except if you are terminated in your probation period (first 6 months usually). Also employees who have completed 5 years or more need to serve 2 months notice. the company is liable to pay only the notice period; the pending vacation balance if any and the indemnity calculated on the last earned basic salary. hope this helps

Very Frankly saying; Don't think about legal action. it will never work. gratuity per year is of 21 days. So if you didn't took it previously; you will get all your dues. Try to find a median solution. insha Allah everything will be fine
Q6_R3_C9 Good
Gratuity is paid @ 21 days per year which is calculated on your last basic salary. In your case u said that you are working for the last 6 years here in Qatar with a gross salary of QR.5000/month. So let us assume your date of joining is January 01; 2004 and your basic salary is QR.4000. If so; the calculation is as follows: 01.01.2004 to 31.12.2011 = 21x8 = 168 Days So your gratuity is calculated as = 4000x168x12/365 = QR.22;093.15 Apart from this; your employer should provide a ticket to your home country. The notice period up to 5 five years from the date of joining is 1 month and above that; 2 months. In your case the notice period is 2 months. Gratuity/indemnity is settled net of any staff receivables/recoveries.

6 months ban without NOC could be possible? Please read & comments. However; the law makes it illegal for sponsors and employers to retain employees’ passports and travel documents once their residence permits have been issued. According to Article 4; any expatriate once dismissed from his job or quit on his own will not be allowed to re-enter the country before the elapse of two years from the date of his departure. However; this condition can be waived by the Minister of Interior; or whoever represents him. Also the department (to be designated later) in charge of enforcing the law may exempt some cases from this period based on a written permission from the expatriates’ previous sponsor; according to Article 4. The new law gives the Minister or whoever represents him the power to transfer sponsorship temporarily if there is a legal dispute between the sponsor and the expatriate worker.

Hi to all; I'm six years now working my company can i get my 5 years gratuity pay from my company? Any labor law related to it? Thanks for your help.
Q6_R39_C1 Good
no...u can only get gratuity once u leave the company.
Q6_R39_C2 Good
when u resign or the company terminates u then u can get 21 days for each year of service this is the law
Q6_R39_C3 Good
gratuity is payable/receivable at end of service (its an end of service benifit).
Q6_R39_C4 Good
Yes you can. In other countries its end of service benefit... but here I have seen 5yrly withdrawal in Govt and non govt organisations.
Q6_R39_C5 Bad
i did not get you jackmohan. please clarify.
Q6_R39_C6 Good
jackmohan means that since you have already completed your 5 years in your company; you can now get your gratuity in advance even if you are not yet leaving your company as he has seen in some other organisations that they can receive or withdraw their gratuity every 5 years...
Q6_R39_C7 Good
well for information of all !!!!!!!!!!! as per Qatar labor law if you complete 05 years in a company; you are eligible for gratuity equivalent to 30 days salary for each year you served in the company.
Q6_R39_C8 Bad
...is it mentioned in the Qatar Labour Law?
Q6_R39_C9 Bad
Im also leaving my coming by end of this month and im claiming my end of service but my company HR manager is asking me to submit the solid proof that company should give 28 or 30 days end of service after 5years completion. Please; clarify or tell us the rule or proof.. tnx
Q6_R39_C10 Good
Gratuity is termed as EOS (End of Service) benefits and can only be availed when one leaves the organization (termination/resignation) As per QLL; for the first 5 years gratuity is calculated on the basis of 21 days per year (some companies give it @ of 30 days irrespective of the no of years)and if one exceeds 5 years then gratuity is calculated @ 30 days per year. Some companies even allow their employees to take their gratuities yearly (if the employees so wish)to reduce their liabilities. Hope this helps
Q6_R46
hey guys. I`m a nurse here in the phils. i just signed a contract for hamad as a staff nurse. the offer is 5600 qatar riyals per month plus 1000 qatar riyal for transportation allowance. Is that a great deal? how about the free accommodation does it look good? I`m anxious about my new job. help pls.
Q6_R46_C1 Good
Regarding the starting salary;if it is your 1st stint to work as nurse overseas; that looks to be fair.with regard to the transportation allowance of QR1;000/month it seem to be reasonable only if your accomodation and the hospital are located in the same city. i mean if you will be assigned in Al Khor or somewhere far and your accomodation is in Doha; then that might need to be adjusted. Hamad provide pretty decent housing or the other staff gets housing allowance. I am not a nurse but I know some nurse working with Hamad. Hamad is a government Hospital and in general they give higher salary than the private clinics/hospitals. Can you provide me Hamad's Agency and contact address in the Philippines as it could also be an option for my nurse daughter in the future. She just passed the nursing board exam and barely starting her 1st job this month.
Q6_R46_C2 Bad
thanks gt. lucero. i applied in Unistaff agency. it is located in Boyle st palanan makati city; presently they are hiring nurses with 3 yrs of experience in special areas like ICU; OR or ER. Hamad work sounds good. hows the working condition of pinoy nurses there in qatar?
Q6_R46_C3 Good
"Your salary is fair enough for an entry level nurse; the question is where your accomodation will be. bachelor accomodation means you will be sharing with two to three persons per flat or apartment; nationalities of which you will be sharing it with will depend on the vacancies available. there are 4 HMC hospitals; plus one for openning this year; in doha all located in proximity of each other with one in far off al khor; if you will be assigned in al khor; your accomodation will be in proximity of AKH. its a different environment than back home; not all patients know english. Good luck! For Mr. Lucero; the agency that i know of is universal staffing services in makati located near south superhighway near border of makati and manila.

Buddy; cheaper cars on rental basis are easy to find in Qatar but the car owners make very strict conditions. i had a bad experience for finding cheaper car like you on rental basis as there was a condition that if car involves in an accident and it's not my fault; i still have to pay the rent for car for the days it stays in garage. THAT'S REDICULOUS.... Big rent a cars like AVIS; BUDGET or THRIFTY etc. you don't have to worry about any thing bcz even you crash their cars; you just have to pay small amount as these cars are fully insured rather than those small rent a cars; who are just waiting for a prey (Customer) and suck all the money you have.... May be it's just me and i don't have any intention to discourage you to get a cheaper car if budget is a concern of yours. Have a safe and joyful weekend.
Q7_R26
Have any expats on this forum either bought property in Qatar; or considered buying and then rejected - i.e zig zag towers; the Pearl etc ? I'm trying to evaluate whether or not this would be a good investment. What do you think are the potential risks and upsides ? If you have bought; what was your experience of the process and in hindsight; was it a good decision ? Regards
Q7_R26_C1 Good
Personally.. i think the real estate industry may start a down slide soon; it seems like Rents have skyrocketed within the last year or two; It is likely that the asian games had soemthing to do with this and i just can not imagine the prices of real estate maintaining this insane rate for much longer. Something has to give. On the flip side of the coin; Qatar has been and still is expanding at a fast rate; there could continue to be a growth spurt and that would mean that more housing would be needed for workers... I'm absolutly no help am I? lol~ sorry :(
Q7_R26_C2 Good
I just brought on Lagoon Plaza; so I am hoping the market doesnt come down anytime soon. Personally while all this building is going on and while there is a buzz about the place then I think prices for property will keep rising. I was reading a Dubai site the otherday saying prices are beginning to drop due to over supply. I think that problem is a long way off here. Plus I brought because my company will give me a housing allowance so they will be paying for my investment and when you look at it like that its a no brainer. Icidently I did look at the Pearl it is going to be very nice but just not soon enough and I think they are a bit over priced.
Q7_R26_C3 Good
Hey. I looked at a place on the Pearl in Sabban Towers; which will be the first completed tower on the pearl. I; unfortunately couldn't get the finance fast enough so i lost the apartment; the tower is now sold-out. Property prices are rising roughly 10% per month at the moment and trust me that is not going to slow down in a hurry. They just will never beable to build fast enough to catch up with the demand as has happened in Dubai. I definitely think it is a good invetsment; even if the appreciation on the property slows down to 10% per annum that is still a good investment when you condsider the fact that you are currently just pouring your rent money into someone else's pocket or mortgage and you could be putting that into your on property which you can redeem when you sell the place. For at least the next ten years your investment will be very safe; that being said who knows what will happen if America goes after Iran? There is no return without risk though as i am sure you know a.....
Q7_R26_C4 Bad
What is the problem; I would maybe have a few doubts about the Pearl just becasue its reclaimed land but my tower built on solid ground out of concrrete. I think it will be ok for some time to come. The finishing in this country is appauling but you can't argue that the building are not solid.
Q7_R26_C5 Good
Property even in the building I have brought in has gone up 20% since its launch. The Pearl is adding 10% to each phase. Its going to keep going; and you are right why should my company put rent money into someone elses pocket when they can pay towards my mortgage. I am happy with 10% apprication on the property. I would have got 5% in the bank and realistically its going to be more than that. 10 years is probably about the right amount of time to keep hold of it. By then you will have Loisil Wackra Al Khor etc all built and it will be an established market. Until then I am holding for the ride.

I am now considering Lusail as an option but i am wondering if it is going to be too far out initially and will show a slower appreciation. I have seen it happen in Dubai; the original western villa area is the Springs and Meadows near the Dubai Marina and the Palm Jumeriah. They have subsequently built the Arabian Ranches and while the Springs etc has continued to appreciate dramatically the Ranches is struggling a bit. Now i believe that the lagoons and the Pearl will soon become the centre of Doha and Lusail will be the suburbs do you think the places there are going to hold their value as well as the Pearl? Whats your opinion; i would be interested to know as you seem to have the same ideas about the property market that i do?

Thanks for that qatexpat..... You might want to elaborate on that very dismissive statement.... Why do you feel that its not worth it and what do you base your statement on?
Q7_R26_C10 Good
"You sound pretty vague in your confidence; When you say ""I hope"" and ""I think"" but you conclude pretty confidently with the term ""no-brainer"". The prices of Lagoon are above a million for a one bed appartment. Such prices in the heart of Dubai Marina have now crashed to 0.55 million. Still Dubai has a higher brand equity and better business environment. I am sure you might have done much more research and assessment of the scenario before getting in. Please elaborate further on your analysis. Anyone who buys is pretty convinced of his moves specially when there is no clarity on ownership and legislation. The other factor that has literally killed the Dubai market is the very high figure of Annual maintenance charges of about 10AED/Sq ft/Year. Please share your analysis with us. PS: I am not critiquing or analysing your decision to buy. I am only seeking more information that you may like to share with us on your analysis. Quiet lurker. Poor Contributer"

The line is blurred; right? They would say they are in a loving relationship...and they live; drive and eat beyond their means. It is why they came to the country; to snare a rich Qatari.

Q8_R65_C4 Good
Who said that? Maybe you're wrong...Or maybe the Europeans car producers are targeting the top of the game and; like all the top quality products; are not cheap...If you want a easy maintenance car; try TATA...If you want a luxury car; tray Lamborghini; Ferrari; Mercedes; BMW; Saab; Volvo; Jaguar; Porsche;Volkswagen. There are also producers like Opel; Renault; Citroen; Fiat; Seat which are producing relatively cheap cars but very reliable and easy to maintain... So; if you got money for a Mercedes; you have to have money to maintain! Peace; I'm stick with my national pride: Dacia! The ultimate European cheap car!

what kind of question is this and that also bieng an eng.
Q8_R67_C2 Good
Hahahaha...i feel like talking to a 3 yr old kid!!! Yes; it does stay STILL in the AIR before landing because it has to wait for approval. If they are not approved; the pilot can just turn the plane 360 degrees without moving forward and go back to it's destination. nyahahahahah!!!! Did you notice the propeller on top of every aeroplane? That's what keeps it still before landing. Some plane have propellers on their tail as well; but those are only special types of plane developped by aliens.
Q8_R67_C3 Bad
I am not asking about helicopters. I know they can. I am asking about Airbus. I had a feeling that they can't be still; as helicopters do. Sorry If you feel my question as childish. But it has to be cleared my doubt; better than keeping in my kind.
Q8_R67_C4 Good
"Certain Fighter aircraft can ""stop"" while in flight if the pilot does certain maneuvers but during landing? Of course not. On a passenger aircraft? Of course not."
Q8_R67_C5 Good
NO an air bus cannot stay still; at any moment during flight. The wings cross section make it such that most of the air is forced downwards and smaller fraction over the wings; pushing the plane upwards. Air must be moving toward the plane for the wing to push it below. So the aircraft must be moving towards the air; to get this effect. for the smarter ones out there; you should know that; the speed at which the air hits the wings (basically the aircraft speed plus speed of opposing wind) is proportional to the amount of lift given. helicopters are the same; only that the rotor blades; are the wings and they constantly move in at circular path.
Q8_R67_C6 Good
Commercial aircraft: No Fighter aircraft: Yes. The VTOL enabled planes can do that. VTOL= vertical take off and landing. The Harrier Jump jet is one such aircraft. Google VTOL and you will find a lot of info as well as some youtube videos.
Q8_R67_C7 Bad
hmmm; i think i seen venks on MasterMind a a week or so ago. His Specialist Subject was VTOL also... hmmmmmm
Q8_R67_C8 Good
"Not only can an Airbus (or any other commercial aircraft) not ""stand still"" in the air; it must be going at least 155 knots (or approx 175 miles per hour) in order to stay in the air; relative to the wind speed. If it falls below that relative speed it will simply fall out of the air. I remember in the middle of one flight; a passenger called the flight attendant and asked; ""Why have we stopped?"" Uhhh; ...?!"
Q8_R67_C9 Good
Technically; a commercial jet can stay still in the air provided we cause the wind to blow at it from the opposite direction at over 600Kmph. This wind must blow towards the nose and through its wings to cause it to get lift force and thus not make any displacement relative to the ground. This wud means it has zero ground speed. An aircraft has two speeds namely groundspeed and airspeed. Airspeed is measured by the amount of air rushing thro' its sensors placed at various points on its outer body. This mechanism and physical aspect of flight is beyond the scope of this discussion and many of you won't even be able grasp the idea.

okay girls....this is a doubt that has been bugging me since quite some time.i've been using this particular shampoo since a few months.it promises to give health and shine to hair.but there are other shampoos which give bounce;strength;volume;etc.is it okay if i mix a couple of shampoos and use?i asked one of my friends and she says it's not advisable.... what do y'all think?
Q8_R70_C1 Good
"My stylist actually recommends that I change shampoos every once in a while. The reasoning is that your hair becomes used to the particular shampoo and looses a bit of it effectiveness. I mix shampoos; I generally use moisturizing but I do use a clarifying shampoo for a week or so every couple of months. Did your friend say why you shouldnt use different shampoos? ""Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"""
Q8_R70_C2 Bad
thanks for the advice;dear.was a bit confused actually.well;my friend didn't exactly put a finger down on as to WHY she thinks mixing shampoos is not a good idea.she says if that was possible then every company would make an all-effect shampoo too.coz everyone wants their crowning glory to look the best.i tried reasoning with her that it could be a marketing strategy too.she didn't seem to agree..... Keep smiling! Saggi!
Q8_R70_C3 Good
Never heard mixing shampoo to be a problem...might have to look into that. I have heard that a protein based shampoo is best and it is the conditioner that effects the hair more. What about mixing conditioners?   I may be blonde but I am wise smile lots laugh more
Q8_R70_C4 Good
except that whatever is in one; might counteract the other's effectiveness...so why bother? Case in point...you use a shampoo used for moisture; which usually contains a bit of oil...then mix it with a clarifying shampoo...you just deleted the oil from the mixture because that's what a clarifying shampoo does... Just alternate days you use the different shampoos. Be much better for your hair Grant me the senility to forget the people I never liked;the good fortune to run into the ones I do;and the eyesight to tell the difference.

I've been in Doha for quite a while now; but I still haven't experienced really authentic butter chicken like the ones you get in India. The butter chicken over here is a bit bland to serve the arabian palate and doesn't do the dish justice. Any suggestions where you can get the real deal? FYI I've been to Shaalimaar (the Indian restaurant near the airport); Bukhara and AliShaan but none of them cut it; for me at least.
Q8_R89_C1 Good
This is a little restaurant near where I live. All the men that work there come from all all areas of Indian; so they know loads of great and different Indian recipes. Thier Butter Chicken is to die for. It is a very clean place; the staff are lovely and love kids etc. It is as cheap as chips. I; because I am female; could not give you the road it is on. But if you get to the mini rounabout at The Mall; just over Jaidhah flyover or coming from Ramada Junction; head as if you are going to the Party Shop; not the party shop that is surrounded by other shops. The one that looks older. Anyway; head towards that. Oh; the sign for Pyschiatrict help should be on your left. (Not joking). Carry on until you get to some traffic lights. Then turn left.

God bless Sheikh Hamad; such an open minded prince on all other religions and nationalities. i mean we are not hurting any1. just prayin on our own and we even mention Qatar and wish Sheikh Hamad all the best for him and his country Qatar. Good things will lead to good things!

Qatar is already the host of Religious Peace talks; so I'd say that Qatar is taking a step in the right direction. There are also talks of a Temple being built. @heero; there is no law in Qatar against selling Bibles; the shop owners are free to sell what they want. Go open a Bible shop and sell all the Bible's you want. There's no consipiracy going on. __________________________ Mr. Q's Blog - A Qatari's view on Qatar .

Baptist here? I don't know; but I think there is; you can also try a search in the search box. There has been a few discussions about this on QL. But seriously; why Baptist or make this more complicated and divided by separating it into denominations? *sigh* Incase people don't know what a Baptist is: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptist
Q9_R41_C2 Bad
"QUESTIONS OF LABELING (excerpt from wiki) Some who reject the label Baptist prefer to be labeled as Christians who attend Baptist churches. Also; a recent trend (most common among megachurches and those embracing the ""seeker movement"") is to eliminate ""Baptist"" from the church name; as it is perceived to be a ""barrier"" to reaching persons who have negative views of Baptists; whether they be of a different church background or none The label denomination is rejected by some because of the local autonomous governance system used by Baptist churches. Being a denomination is viewed by them as having a hierarchy that substitutes for the Roman Catholic Church. Another reason for the rejection of the label is the influence of the Restoration period on Baptist churches; which emphasized a tearing down of denominational barriers."

One question for those of you who have travelled to Sri Lanka on holidays and for them Sri Lankas here in Doha. How would you advise me to spend 10 days in Sri Lanka in August? How would you plan my itininary? I like nature; historical place; good street food; mountains; rivers. I will spend minimal time in the hotel. Thank you all for your advice.
Q9_R43_C1 Good
I was there for a week...beautiful country. Try visiting places like Nuwara eilya ( mountais with lots of tea plantations) Visit the buddist temple in Kandy; if you like beaches visit Gale; Hikkaduwa u can see giant turtles and also go diving. Take a train ride you will see some of the best views. Srilanka is not famous for their street food and its not something u want to try there; its way too spicy specially if you are not used to it.
Q9_R43_C2 Bad
Thank you every_mothers_n I will indeed try to eat those street food. I just love them. I tried street food in Calicut; Bombay; Agra...well I love it...I am just attracted to them. By the way; do I need any vaccination before travelling to Sri Lanka.

Q9_R43_C6 Good
My dear don't worry. Sri Lanka is a safe & beautiful country. Go to Nuwara Eliya (hill country with tea plantation) & Kandy (Buddhist temple). Enjoy the beach from Wadduwa to Galle. (Down south) Don't forget to go on a wildlife safari. (Yala; Udawalawa; Bundala or Wilpatthu). You can stay in a wildlife bungalow as well. (you need to book in advance). Then visit some ancient & historical places like Sigiriya rock; Dambulla temple; Anuradhapura; Polonnaruwa & Kathragama. Enjoy your trip..........

I think August would b ideal since it is the dry season for most part of the country. Here's what i propose. I haven;t included the beaches since you have not listed it under your interests. 01 Colombo - exploring old fort/ wonderful seafood 02 Yala - Wildlife Safari 01 Kithulgala - White water rafting 01 Kandy - Sacred Temple of Tooth 01/02 Sigiriya - Lion Rock Rest of the days - Nuwara Eliya ( Mountains and cooler weather) If you spare a few more days a good walk in the Sinharaja rainforest is recommended.

Q9_R45_C1 Good
...massively on History Channel and NatGeo multiple times. There are many theories which support this: 1. The concept of the Mayan Doomsday Prophesies matches with that of the chinese yin yan and Nostradamaus and they all agree that 21 st Dec 2012 is the doomsday. 2. Astrologers and Astronomers agree with the Geophysicsts that this particular day is of an extra ordinary importance in terms of celestial alignment of the Sun with the thirteenth sign of the astrology and might cause unpredictable results which might be catastrophic. I think we will have to wait till the day itself to find out. But undoubtely it is one of the most striking theories on Doomsday ;) Source: - A study Conducted by FriedUnicorn - Vol I (September;1999)

Q10_R22
Did you guys see the Qatarchat blogosphere? http://www.qatarchat.8m.com/rich_text_7.html It is each and every one of QL blogs. I already talked to the guy; his name is Abin; to take the blog list off the website. I dont mind my blog being there; but the least they could do was ask somebody for permission before doing it. If he or the web admins had asked Qatari's or Ahmd's permission; then i take my words back. Otherwise; trust me; I AM MIGHTILY PISSED!!!
Q10_R22_C1 Bad
Greeker; how do they do that w/o permission? I'm not technosavvy enough to know if they can 'steal'.
Q10_R22_C2 Bad
i am not sure either. And I am ashamed to say that it was an Indian like me who picked up the phone at the other end. He should be ashamed of himself; but hey; lifting things off the website without permission is the latest fad. Dammit. I am seething with fury right now. But they did the mistake of giving their mobile number in their site. Atleast i know who to TALK TO if they dont keep their promise and take the damn thing off in an hour.

I think someone posted a map where a person can die here in Doha; wouldn't it be a good advice to post it here for his information? Seriously though; why need a gun? Do we have gangsters or druglord (like Mexico)? Do we have high criminality rates (like the US)? Do we have civil war or conflicts (like Syria / Lebanon)? I can't think of a sane reason why you would need a gun; except as what smoke has said or you just want to suddenly off your boss or officemates. If that is the case; please tell me now so I can transfer employment to where I am far away from you...

Q11_R31_C7 Good

Q11_R31_C8 Good
Insha' Allaah it may be on 7th November Since the Islamic calendar is purely lunar; as opposed to solar or luni-solar; the Muslim (Hijri) year is shorter than the Gregorian year by about 11 days; and months in the Islamic (Hijri) year are not related to seasons; which are fundamentally determined by the solar cycle. This means that important Muslim festivals; which always fall in the same Hijri month; may occur in different seasons. For example; the Hajj and RamDHaan can take place in the summer as well as the winter. It is only over a 33 year cycle that lunar months take a complete turn and fall during the same season.

Hi everyone; my Husband has just got a Job with Qatar Airways and i'm hoping to get my three children into a British School in Doha in September 2012; i need a place in Year 3; Year 2 and Reception. can anybody advise on how likely that is ? i'm not sure if i should stay in the UK until i can get the children into a School or could that be a really long wait ??? any information would be greatly received; Many Thanks XX
Q12_R11_C1 Good
"Wait and only apply to Doha English Speaking School. If they get accepted then leave the UK. This school is only British school which follow the actual British curriculum and is monitored by the British educational council. All the rest of the British school claim they ""follow"" the British curriculum. Who is there to monitor the school? If you PAY for a private company to accredit the school; they will come out and give you accreditation. You will find out that your child will be a year behind because majority of the schools don't have the textbooks for each subject in the class. Nor do they have a curriculum without textbooks or manuals.

DESS although the best has LONGGGGG waiting list and is until primary. For me ; no harm putting them into the waiting list & pray that you will get a place. To me there are other good ones like Doha College; Parkhouse; Sherbourne & Doha British School which you can consider. Due to personal preference; I have seen parents transferring their kids within these few schools too. Alternatively you let your husband settled here first.. find a school before you guys come over. All schools require entrance exam before they are accepted. So whenever a place becomes available; do prepare to fly them immediately.

There are some great new schools opening; for instance the International School of London or the American College School (though obviously not British curriculum). I've switched my daughter from Park House (a British school I STRONGLY recommend you avoid); to the aforementioned ACS-- they had immediate availability; being so new. Also; many schools have relationships with certain companies; so check if that is true for your husband's company. Good luck!

My husband also works for Qatar Airways. Now is an excellent time to apply for schools here as they are sorting places for Sept 2012. I am a teacher and it was a worry trying to get our daughter into a school. We arrived at the wrong time of year and it took a while to get her into a school so I had to home teach for a while. However; this time last year we got our daughter into Doha College. She has come on in leaps and bounds and we are thrilled with the school. The school has recently been inspected and did extremely well. They use the British Curriculum so the transition from UK to Doha College was very easy! Your children will need to sit an assessment but it's nothing to worry about. You will also need previous school reports from their current UK school. Other schools that we were impressed with were DESS and Sherbourne. Hope that helps! Good luck! :)
Q12_R11_C8 Good
"I disagree with Expatemily (I am a friend in real life with her) Park House is a great school. Also loads of Qatar Airway people. I have 3 kids in the school. Other good schools (based on my dealings with the schools and friends comments) are Doha (Montisori) British School; Doha Collage; Doha English Speaking School. These four schools are also ""reasonably"" priced. The American schools are crazy expensive. I suggest applying to all of those schools now (as in today!). Places often open up over the summer and Park House requires a deposit on next year from current students in May for September so you could still easily get places. Having 3 children is an advantage because one one gets a place it tends to bounce the others up on the waiting list."

"Everytime I log on here and see comments about schools I chuckle at the amount of best schools that are listed. To date I believe there might be about 6 ""best"" schools in doha; based on what; usually perception based on how well a particular child is doing at that school at that moment. It seems to me that if a child is struggling or not doing particulalry well then first thing to do is blame the school ""it must be the school"". A well motivated pupil will thrive in most environments and from what I have come across so far most of the schools are okay; as long as they are not for profit...we are never going to replicate a top british school but why would we want to as one of the benefits here is the multi culturalism. Of course places are tight but I dont think people should stress as much about the schools.

Cactiflora i think ur better off working for Malaysia Airlines. I hear there's no job stability with QA; and thats something u dont want to be worrying about all the time. I dont understand they say that if you make one mistake your more then likly to be sacked; and i travelled by QA once and their services were totally F*ckall!! First of all they were supposed to do a hotel booking on my return ticket which wasnt even confirmed till the time i was at the airport waiting for someone to pick me up from the hotel. Secondly the hotel that they did put us up in was in some freaking god forsaken sh*t hole in Mumbai; that even the taxi drivers didnt know where it was. I mean the staff at the QA are totally useless since they fill them with all inexperienced FEMALES just coz of their good looks.

Newton is a great school :) with great teachers!
Q12_R26_C6 Good
Definitely; Definitely; Definitely; Definitely Sherborne. If you do a search on QL; you find a number of complaining threads about NBS and almost all positive views of Sherborne. Sherborne is relatively new; but it is growing into secondary and has a good reputation for quality teachers and good resources. Once in Qatar; you should also have a close look at DESS; Doha College; Park House and Compass--the waiting lists are probably full for this year; but there is always the next and such thinks need to be well planned in Doha. My children are at DESS; which is primary only. A number of the parents I know of have chosen Sherborne over even Doha College for secondary; which is a good sign of its growing reputation. Good luck.
Q12_R26_C7 Good
Sherborne has a better reputation amongst parents as having better facilities and teachers; but as said above it's new and so doesn't have as long a history to create complaining parents. There have been a number of debates about Newton on QL but the consensus is that Sherborne a quality option. I know parents who have had children at both; but; to be honest; the parents with children at Newton have pulled their children out to place them elsewhere--they cited poor management primarily but were not happy with their teachers either. The Sherborne parents remain happy with their choice. Either way; I would suggest putting your children on the wait lists for places like DESS and Doha College; which are the best British-curriculum schools in the city (but with waiting lists to match). If you plan to be in Doha for a while; its worth the year-long wait to get in. If by that time you've fallen in love with the school your children are in; then nothing is lost.

I get the feelin' that some people on here are rating schools according to how many expats (read white) go there. More expats at a British school then it must better. So what if Newton has all of about four white Brit kids; still good be a good school.
Q12_R26_C9 Good
If you look the 'negative' comments 2020 is referring to; they are from years ago; mostly from 2007. The school has obviously developed and continues to improve. As I have said in another 'Newton' forum; 2020; for some reason; has something against me on QL so I would not let this cloud your judgement. Furthermore all 3 schools have just been internationally accredited and were inspected by SEC and AdvanceED and all got glowing reports. All inspectors have got great experience of the British curriculum all over the world and have high expectations. Also my parents have all expressed their satisfaction with their children's education and progress and I have new children starting in term 3. I have no gain or benefit of giving positive feedback about the Newton schools; my pay will stay the same as I'm not on commission. I have friends who taught at Cambridge and they would never give positive feedback or recommend new children to come as it was dyer. Lagoon school is a brand new school i.....

Anyone know how that works? Apparently I need a referral from MY doctor. I'm new here so I am not quiet sure who ""my doctor"" is. Then I need an appointment with the doctor at Hamad Hospital; and he decides if I need one? Otherwise I have to pay around 1000QR at a private hospital; which is very expensive. Suggestions please?"
Q12_R27_C1 Good
I think you would need to get a referral from your PHC doctor that is a doctor from your own PHC. Basically you would need to have a health card of HMC to have your PHC AP
Q12_R27_C2 Good
Who asked you to go for an MRI; that doctor can give a referral for hamad hospital; requesting a MRI. Appointment can take upto a month. I don't think it's necessary for the phc dr to give a referral or that you need to check again with a dr at hamad. I had a referral once directly from A private clinic for an MRI. but rules change. You can check with the dr you are following up your problem with; ask him or her for a referral and then go to hamad hospital X-ray MRI unit and check about the appointment. They are usually helpful; and if they appear uncooperative; please complain since their customer service takes such things seriously; but I don't think you will get such a problem. Their staff is usually helpful; sometimes it can take more than 3 staff members to give you the right picture but they will try and help you and guide you.
Q12_R27_C3 Good
May Allah gives you good health. In order to get any service from HMC; you need a Health card. Alongwith the Health card; go with your private Doctor MRI referral to the Main HMC MRI section or Al-rumaila MRI section ang get the appointment. So simple. Best regards.
Q12_R27_C4 Good
Secure a health card if you have not done so already by visiting the Health Center of your area with a pp size photograph and QR 100. (Of course you need to be an RP holder to be eligible) It might take a couple of days or even more to be with you. With that in hand visit your local health center again and see any GP with your complains; let him refer you to some specialist in Hamad related to your complain. Take an appointment of the specialist in Hamad. If luck is by your side and depending on the specialization you have been referred to; it might take somewhere between 1 to 6 months before you could see the specialist. Last time when I was there to take an appointment for evening clinic (not free even with health card); I was told that the appointment system itself is being upgraded and no appointment is possible until January next year. So watch out. Now if you are really lucky and you get to see the specialist and he feels that you need an MRI Scan done; he will issue you a paper .....
Q12_R27_C5 Good
Hi flexicode; you can see a doctor at hamad without going through the health centre. I have had two appointments with different doctors and one for my family member; by directly asking for an appointment.ofcourse you don't get the appt immediately; depending upon the doctor; some specialists are available within a week's time; while renowned consultants have a std waiting period of 45 days; miss that appt and the next one is after another 45 days.grrrr;downside of waiting to meet a consultant is that if he is on a casual leave on the day of the appointment; they don't inform you and some junior dr will see you; beats the point of actually taking an appt with a consultant and then waiting to see him. It helps if you have a referral and a referral by a private dr should be fine too. Most important is to have a health card;once you have applied; they issue you a receipt; you can use the hospital services with the receipt.
Q12_R27_C6 PotentiallyUseful
I must add that they keep changing their rules so one month you can get an appt over the phone and the next month they would ask you to go to the phc first for a different appt. Moreover getting an MRI done outside could cost almost 1500 or more;depending upon the area being scanned. But it depends on how worried you are about your condition; and the cost is nothing; you get your results quickly; but if you can wait; its better to get into the national health care system; its not costly; and let them take care of you. Hope you feel well soon.
Q12_R27_C7 Bad
Firstly thank you all for the quick and informative responses. Nobody has actually ASKED me to get an MRI; but I want to do it myself as I am worried about my back. My lower back has been aching me for about 2 weeks now; and yesterday the upper right side of my back starting hurting. I visited a Doctor and he instantly told me that it is NOT a slipped disc; and is just a muscle spasm as the pain doesn't extend to my legs; though I still want to be certain as I want to start working out again; but I don't want to mess with my back if I shouldn't. And he said the upper back pain was also normal; and not related to a slipped disc whatsoever. Thanks again!
Q12_R27_C8 Good
Hello; sad to hear about your back pain. Your dr is right; if your pain is not extending to your limbs and are not feeling any pain or numbness in your fingers or toes; feet; then you don't need to worry. It's possible that you have injured yourself during your workout or is due to your work position; the way you sit at your desk; the way you sit while driving etc. Slip disc would give you excruciating pain; even simple tasks can become difficult; I am not sure if slip disc is the same as disc bulge; but in a disc bulge; if it starts touching the nerve; then you can have crazy tingling pain. You can try asking for an appointment with a dr.arun at hamad hospital in the evening clinic; or try to meet him at alkhor hospital. He is available in Doha only on Tuesday the other days; he is in alkhor.waiting time can be long; because he quite sought after. You can also meet dr.bhat at Doha clinic; he is one of the best and a longtimer in Doha. I would advice you to refrain from weight training.....
Q12_R27_C9 Bad
Hey han19; Thank you so much for the reply; and the advice. I feel so much better knowing that it hopefully most likely is NOT a slipped disc. Being so young; and having started a new career; it would really not be a good thing. I have stopped weight training completely for now which sucks; but do you think it would be a good idea to introduce it very mildly? You think jogging is okay? I want to meet a proper Doctor; even if at a private hospital; as the guy at Hamad was busy; and only barely gave me any advice. I am sure a proper doctor can give me advice as to how exactly the right position is to sleep; to sit; etc. Maybe can give me some exercises to do to help me recover faster. You know any Doctor; even at a private hospital you specifically would recommend? These problems are to do with the Radiology section is that right? Forgive me as I know VERY little about hospitals and such problems; as I have had very few problems in the past (touch wood). Thank you again
Q12_R27_C10 Good
Hi Hmd; I would not advice you to do any strength training till you back pain subsides. Are you a heavy person. Brisk walking is preferred to jogging as in jogging you are putting a lot of impact on your lower back; as well as our knees. If you are a heavy person then you shuld try to avoid jogging n skipping.brisk walk is great again body posture is important. The stomach muscles support the back; so you need to firm up our stomach. A good physiotherapist can suggest some basic exercises; especially for the back and they really help. They are very simple; if you are into exercises u should know the cobra posture; cat stretch; simple leg lifts while lying down. For sitting position try to google office ergonomics and they usually have a standard picture that shows how one should be seated at an office desk. Wile driving; if you drive long distance; you need to move your neck frequently. You may call Doha Clinic hospital; and ask for Dr. Bhat; he is very good and his treatment is usuall.....

very diffrent mate; blood in our body; replenished by our own system; water in the desert process of evaporation.. car oil... hhmm you have to replenish it manually.. in time the oil in an engine will deplete due to the heat and the internal combustion happening inside the engine; in time there will be no oil left; the friction will increase ; since the engine is mechanical it will spead up wear and tear or the pistons and the bore inside resulting to an piston sieze-up or the piston ring breaks and everything will just stop.. hope this answers you question.

What is the basic salary for a staff nurse in Qatar? Is the salary scale based on years of experience? Which hospital in Doha has the best offer for nurses? with great allowances and salary?
Q13_R27_C1 Good
Nurses salary are very low here and are not based on anything - they just pay you a salary and thats it. Not too sure about allowances.
Q13_R27_C2 Good
Staff Nurse First Level Basic = QR 5500 Transport allowance = QR 1250 Shift allowance = 10% of basic Special allowance 10% of basic for ER/DR/OR and some special area Yearly return Ticket or cash equivalent if desired 45 days paid leave yearly or about 3.5 days accumulation per month of service.. can be converted to cash if desired 40 hours work week (5 days with 8 hour shift) Free accommodation for bachelors (if overseas contract and married with wife or children in Qatar; you can take the money instead = about 5000 QR/month.

Wat is the shift hour like? 3 shift is from wat time to wat time? 5 days of work per week including nite duty? If based on 7 years working experience; how much of basic salary will they give? Is the salary based on races? As I know the canadian nurse usually has higher salary. Is that applicable to hamad? I really appreciate your information given. Thanks for your help.

Many nurses from Hospital Johor Bahru working there since the first group explore the opportunities. I am also from health background but bye.. bye.. MOH. In term of RM i got 20X better than what they can offer me. If me; with the offer that Qatar can give us; better to stay malaysia; get a degree; and apply for Nurse Manager in malaysia @ overseas.

Hi...I've just been offered a job (grade 6) as a Recruitment/HR personel. Basic: QR5400; Housing:QR2500;Transport allowance:QR600 per month. I have only 10 days to take up or reject this offer. Is there room for negotiation with companies in Qatar. My future employer should I take this up will be Qatar Airways. Btw; I am from S'pore. Surely appreciate any kind of help or information. Thank you:)
Q13_R33_C1 Good
Housing is a big problem in Qatar. With your housing allowance you can only manage shared accommodation. If you're lucky you might find something on your own but it won't be very nice. With Qatar Airways there's no room for negotiation; take it or leave it.

Hi...appreciate the fast response. You said if I'm lucky; I might find a place...what happens if I'm unlucky? For 2500...will the room be furnished? I still find the basic pay very low as compared to what I'm currently getting. Is this the average salary for this position in Qatar? I will try negotiating anyway...so I just want to be sure that I'm not taken for a ride. Thanks again:)
Q13_R33_C4 Good
In my humble opinion; you should refuse this job offer flatly and with no regrets... UNLESS: 1- You are 20-27 years old. 2- You are single and have no plans for marriage any time soon. 3- You are a fresh grad out of college and/or have no practical experience in the work field. Basically; accept the job ONLY if it's your entry job into the field after having graduated college recently. You know how to evaluate yourself more than anyone on the forum... this job offer does not sustain any kind of decent living and shouldn't be accepted by anyone unless they really have to. That's just my opinion. By the way; are you male of female? If you're female you might want to consider accepting the job. Sincerely; - DingDong
Q13_R33_C5 Bad

I've been in employment for 10 years...so definitely not a fresh grad. In fact the offer now is equivalent to my very first job years ago...Talk about set back! May I ask in your opinion what would be a reasonably fair offer? Really appreciate your insights...so helpful:)
Q13_R33_C9 PotentiallyUseful
Dingdong ; you started sooo well why did you have to ruin everything at the end? :D Angel; think twice before accepting this offer; specially if it’s not that much in comparison with what you’d be getting in Singapore. Keep in mind that the housing situation is really really bad here and for 2500QR per month I’m not sure what you could possibly get.
Q13_R33_C10 Good
"angel6975; Here are answers to some of your questions: Q1: ""Btw; how much would a person from the west expect?"" A: A WHOLE A LOT more than your offer; at LEAST double! I don't mean to sound racist; I'm only speaking of the reality of the workforce in the region; but don't waste your time comparing your offer to that of someone from the West. If you carry a Western country passport while you're originally from Singapore; then you should expect to be CLOSE (but not equal) to the offer someone from the west is going to get. Now; if you were carrying a Western country passport AND you are originally from the West (i.e. White or light-skinned) THEN you can expected to get the full advantageous treatment someone from the West gets. Again; I REALLY don't want to sound racist; but this is the reality of the market here. Q2: ""And what if it were a senior position?"" A: If it were a senior position AND they still offered you this sum and these allowances; then believe me; it's like a slap in the ....."

Q13_R40_C3 Good
11;000 is too low if it will include rent n all other things; as ur salary will be wasted on monthly expenditure. So do not expect much saving. However; if the rent is taken care of then u r OK :)
Q13_R40_C4 PotentiallyUseful
Gee thanks mochafrap; donkey work is it? And I though being called a glorified receptionist was bad. :( The salary offer is fine Ramon; you'll find it more than enough to live off of. The only problem is with the apartment. Unfortunately the cost of renting in Doha right now is ridiculous and 11;000 should leave you with 1;000 left over each month. Unless they come up with a better offer for accomodation than 4;000 a month shared; don't take the position.

MM: Giving birth at home is now a thing of the past. Midwives are trained professionals who can handle complex situations. About a decade back a colleague of mine tried this procedure of having delivery done at home for his first child. His child is abnormal. Whenever I see that child; the inside of me holds the father responsible for the condition of the child. The father did not repeat the mistake for his other children who are normal and healthy.

please consider another hospital.. they are not experienced and are not capable nor have any facilities to take care of your baby; if there are any complications. I will pm you further details; since i have to leave now. Many serious incidents have occured there over the past weeks and as much as 5-6 babies have had to be rushed to Hamad Hospital because of gross medical negligence on the part of Al Ahli Hospital. I personally know of 1 baby who is still in the NCU of Hamad Hospital now; that had to be transferred from Al-Ahli. Stay far away from al-Ahli hospital and consider Hamad Hospital. Do you want to go to AL-Ahli because u have the money or because u really care for your baby?

Same goes for Doha Clinic. If anything goes wrong; tha ambulance's are rushed to Hamad Medical. Why risk it? I know a girl that gave birth at Al Ahli and the doctor stiched her up that she later couldn't have sex with her husband. She had to go through a minor surgery to correct the mistake. Please have faith in Hamad Medical.
Q14_R5_C8 Bad
Thanks you all for the responses; althought i must say that i've been quite worry about some comments. Are you people sure about those things (that a ahli don't have NICU)?? Did you actually gave birth on hamad or other hospital to say that or this is like that kind of stuff that you hear somebody saying and reapeat as if was realy truth?? I'm asking because chosing a hospital/doctor far away from your home country is a very dificult decision; and al ahli hospital doesn't look like the kind of place you described. I like to hear from someone who actually delivered there. Is there anyone?? Thanks
Q14_R5_C9 Good
Her first three were at Hamad Medical and her last child was born in Al Ahli ONLY because she wanted her husband to attend the delivery. she compared all four deliveries and decided never to go back to Al Ahli. They are rude and broke her water - without her approval. She was emotionally and phsycologically abused by the nurses there. They wouldn't call her doctor when she was asked them to. We had to call her from our personal mobiles. Not a very pleasant experience. I'm having all my children at Hamad Medical.

hi; i too an indian and delivered a baby girl just 4months back at DOHA CLINIC..Well to tell u frankly HMC may charge QR 200-QR 800 both for c-section and normal (not so sure)..since we were utmost cuatious with my first delivery; i opted for PRIVATE centre ; that is; DOHA CLINIC. DOHA CLINIC --- Charges for NORMAL DELIVERY is QR 6900-7300 with 2days stay including meal; nursin chrgs;consumables;medication etc etc. Charges for C-SECTION is QR 11900/- with 3-4days stay including meal; nursing chrgs;consumables; medication etc etc. Al AHLI --- I enquired about the charges only once.and as far as my memory is concerned; the charges for NORMAL SECTION is QR 8000-9000 and C-SECTION is QR 13000-14000/- HMC --- The charges r very minimal and affordable... Its upto u whether u want to go for private or govt.one..I continued going to MUMTAZAH CLINIC CENTRE till my 30weeks but then they referred me to HMC..HMC requires lots of patience and queue; i turned down the idea of delivery there..DOHA CL.....

Our experience of HMC has been very good. My wife delivered two kids; one of them developed complications after birth. They took very good care of the daughter and released only when she was perfect. I think it all depends on who is the consultant and may be it was our good luck.
Q14_R7_C5 PotentiallyUseful
"Perhaps you are all aware that even if you pay for delivery in a private clinic and there is some seriuos complication you will be sent to Hamad hospital. Also; you will be sent to Hamad for any serious cases which the private hospitals cannot deal with. What does this tell you? Hamad hospital delivers around 35-40 babies PER DAY... if anything else practise does make perfect. You are being too harsh on Hamad hospital (who offers you practically free healthcare even though you are only a resident and not a national).... I am not sure of your complaint of disrcimination either... a majority of the nurses and Drs. are Indian... so your difficulties are coming from your own nationality. I delivered in Doha Clinic; never agian. I actually got a scheduled ""Emergency C-section"" at 38 weeks... and the Dr. was trying to cut my baby out at 36-37 weeks (Dont worry; they were going to give me lots of meds to develope the babies lungs!!!!)"

"My wife had her delivery at HMC; and i should say; it is by far the best facilities and care i've seen; especially for the babies. don't believe in urban legends that HMC is this; and that. That's BS!!! I'm in the medical field; and i can assure you that both the safety of the baby and mothers are their top priority. My baby was born 4 weeks premature; so she had to undergo a lot of test. You know what? I didn't pay a single riyal for her tests. Discrimination??? tell me; which hospital doesn't discriminate? will Al ahli give you the ""Best"" treatment if you don't have money? Will Doha Clinic be friendly still if you don't have money? They'll discriminate you; that's for sure. all the things people are saying about HMC is nothing but bull...i don't work there; so then get me wrong. My baby's vaccination and all are FREE!!! instead of paying 10;000 for 3 days; save the 10000 for you're baby's future. also; they are Joint Commission Accredited...if your from India; you're probably familia....."

First of all; congratulations for the comming new baby and may God give him health and strenght! My advice to you is to deliver your baby in HMC; Women's Hospital. They are very good and professional; no other hospital here in Qatar is better than HMC; all the best consultant doctors are in HMC; they deal with a lot of cases; while otheres have let's say 10 deliveries a week in Hamad they will have a lot lot more. And also in Hamad they have all the new equipements and medication; anything you might think of; they have it; becuase they are really investing a lot of money in health care. And although maybe other private hospitals might be good; what most people don't know is that; in case of God forbid; any kind of emergency or unexpected complications; the private hospitals will send the patient to Hamad; because they don't have the training in private for dealing with such situations nor the equipment. I am saying this since it happend recently with a member of my husband's family; sh.....

I forgot to tell you that in Hamad they make all the tests for your baby for free. When I delivered there they actually called me on my mobile one day after discharge to tell me that they forgot to make one test. It was actually a metabolism test; performed in Germany; that could tell if the baby has anything abnormal about his metabolism. It is in fact a very pricy test; only transporting the samples to Germany must cost a fortune. I was impressed by the fact that they called me back and not just dropp it. Now I think they recently brought the equipment to perform this test here in Qatar.

Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) is the best place in Qatar to give birth; no qualms whatsoever. I read a few points mentioned earlier about sharing the room with 3 other ladies; that's true. But this is only if you are willing to pay QR100/- per day. HMC has a dedicated floor for VIPs that could be booked in advance; only that you would be required to pay about QR800/- per day. These are large rooms with good carpets and furniture for only one patient each and it even has a nice luxurious touch to it plus a good living area with sofas for seating/waiting of male guests and kids. This should be a good option; most people (expats) are not aware of this. By the way; there is a huge demand for these rooms. In terms of the medical care you can expect from HMC; I can tell you without doubts that they are very good and its amongst the best in the world. Its true that there could be individual issues at HMC faced by people and no one can guarantee you that you won't face issues. But I am sure .....

I highliy recommend HMC they seem to be the only hospital with FULL readiness to any complications. a friend of mine his wife gave birth at Al-Ahli then immediatly they sent her on an ambulance to HMC as they did not know how to deal with some complications. go for HMC...bad service I know but at least reliable diagnosis and treatment.

Does anybody has an idea the cost of C-section in private hospital in Doha? We are entitled to Hamad-Al Khor but recently I got sick for 2 weeks and soon after; it was my pregnancy that was affected. I am thinking of opting to a private hospital for better care; but this time we will have to cover for all the expenses. Thanks in advance for your help.
Q14_R10_C1 Good
A C-Section in a private hospital can cost you anywhere from 8k to 14k riyals. if you have insurance read the terms properly. You may have to pay the insurance company 600-1000 QR (Depends on the policy). Also; they have a limit for the insurance amount and if the cost is more than the one mentioned then you have to shell out the excess.
Q14_R10_C2 Bad
wow thanks for the very quick response. There will be no insurance for us as it was in my husband's contract that if we will not go to Hamad-Al Khor; we will have to pay for everything. But still; thanks for the idea.

Q14_R10_C4 Good
Hello Incase you dont go for a C Section; I gave birth in Al Khor with my first baby and it was an excellent experience; the level of care was extremely high; and I would certainly recommend it! I am again pregant now; however based in Doha; if I could give birth again in Al Khor I would! Good luck with whatever choice you make; and remember; do what makes you feel comfortable.

Al Khor hospital is better than any private hospitals here for doing your C section.
Q14_R10_C6 Bad
thanks for all those wonderful ideas. I just recently had a bad experience in Hamad Al Khor when I just had a 39.6C fever for so many days and they wouldn't want to give me any good check-up and the status of the baby. Eventually; I went to a private clinic and found out I was so dehydrated and my baby too has very low amniotic fluid and is growing 3 weeks later than its age. The doctors in Hamad were very unwelcomely despite of my fever. So that's why I am thinking of going to private for better care and also for my baby's safety... due on August. Thanks for all of those ideas anyway. They all help and to some readers too!

For the doctor ... there are 2 doctors that keep come up in the forum / conversation. One is Dr.Amal and the other one Dr.Resvi or Dr.Risvi (not too sure with the spelling).
Q14_R14_C4 Good
Hi David; I gave birth here two months ago. I'm from NZ. If this is you and your wife’s first baby then I would recommend you have the baby back home. There is no advice or antenatal classes in Doha. It was not such a great experience for me and I relied a lot on emailing family and friends back home for advise. My husband and I have decided to have our next baby back home so we don’t go through what we went through here. Also do not go to Doha Clinic. Our experience there was traumatic. If you want more information about it I will be happy to explain. We have made an official complaint to the hospital but they don't give a hoot. There is no after care for babies in Doha at any hospital but the best one if you have to go to one is Ali Ahli. They are a new hospital and are quite good. Don't expect your experience here to be anything like it would be in your home country. You are on your own in this country when it comes to having babies. Dr Badi Amal and Dr Rizvi are the two recomme.....

Dr. Rizvi (female) - Al Ahli. Very popular with expat moms. I had great care there. Husband is allowed in room for regular delivery but not if she has to have a c-section. Plenty of info on expatwoman.com on the Qatar chatboard as well. Just do a search. Best wishes.

Hi everyone; in a few weeks I am about to start working for Qatar Airways as a cabin crew. Does anyone know what is the avarage flying time a month for a cabin crew? does it vary for those who just started working than for those who work for QR for some time?

You will get a schedule of work every month. Somedays you will be flying & some days you will be on stand by as mentioned on your schedule & ofcourse somedays you will be off. If you are called on your stand by that will be considered as additional work; not as an overtime though. About promotion; trust me; dont ask them for it. They'll hold you back. When the time is right you will get promoted
Q15_R1_C5 Good
Where ever you go ; what ever you do...Just give in you 100%. They will definately recognize your hard work and commitment. I have personally seen crew getting promoted based on their effort and trust me these people had no flying experience earlier and neither did they know any one in the top managment.Its the hard work.Flying hours are normally as per standards. Once in a while you might get less rest but its not impossible or to hectic to manage that kinda roster. More over you are provided with amazing accomodation; good perks.Its a good company to start. QA is one of most reputed airlines today. So if you pass here you can pass anywhere. Every coins have 2 sides; good and bad. You can choose on what you would like to concentrate. So do not listen to fellow crew; work hard; prove your self and you see the results Be patient and commit your self to your career.

1) why do you want to be a flight attendant? 2) do you consider this as a career? 3) how do you handle stressful situations? 4) how would you handle a complaint? 5) what do u mean by exceptional customer service? Why do you think some passengers take their frustrations out on cabin crew; even though the cabin crew are trying to help them? What would you do if you saw one of your colleagues being deliberately rude to a passenger? If; for example; there are 60 children on the flight; but you only have 40 toys. How would you deal with this situation? What would you do if the seat belt signs were on and the aircraft is about to take off; but a passenger insist that he has to kneel down to conduct his prayer due to religious reasons? What would you do if you lost an engine on take off?
Q15_R6_C3 Bad
What would you do if you lost an engine on take off? 1) Control the aircraft; keeping it on the runway centreline. declaring MAYDAY x 3 2) Rotate and establish a positive climb. 3)Around 400` recall or ECAM actions can be initiated to secure the engine or extinguish any fire. Basically thrust lever to idle; master switch off and then fire swithes and extinguishers if required. 4)Once completed and above Minimum Flap Retraction Altitude (~1000`) accelerate and clean up the aircraft. 5)Once all this is done and safely flying; complete any remaining checklists and prepare for a return forr landing.

shane. There will be In-Sha-Allah bus ways in Qatar; I hope. I hope there be attendants who will manage the 200 people using the buses. Maybe 6 attendants will be enough per bus. I hope; there will be In-Sha-Allah many careers opportunities when there is such a bus system to operate in the Qatari land. I hope; it will be In-Sha-Allah a city bus system. It must be In-Sha-Allah Mowasalt.

Q15_R17
Hi all! I&#39;m a newbie here- a Malaysian guy in aviation and SERIOUSLY considering a career with Qatar Airways. I am an experienced cabin crew. Are there any Qatar Airways expat crew out there willing to share sum tips or experiences about working with Qatar Airways?
Q15_R17_C1 Good
Cactiflora... if you want my advice; try etihad airlines of the UAE. They are newer and you have much more opportunities. If you are experienced you will make cabin manager within a couple of years. Its true that QR pay a little more than etihad but etihad just recently raised their duty allowance to abou US$150 per day. You are also given the option of taking cash instead of accommodation and transport. But the overriding factor; in my opinion; is that QR is awful when it comes to customer service and this reputation is spreading.

Not to mention the fact that they treat all their staff like crap. The staff turnover is ridiculously high especially among westerners

Q15_R17_C4 Bad
wow. i'm joing QA soon; and didn't know bout this. i thought that they have the best customer service in the middle east since they were awarded to be the best by skytrax. geez... i'm now a bit concerned.. what made you say that they treat their staff like crap?
Q15_R17_C5 Good
Qatar Airways is the worst airline I have ever flown on. Always at least a 2 hour delay; the stewards are useless; and they think that just because they give you fancy food and a tv in the seat it will make up for the general rudness of the airline crew and the fact that you are running 2 hours late.
Q15_R17_C6 Good
One of the worst international airlines in the world; in my opinion; for customer care. I think they were voted best airline by business travellers; not the general public. In business or first; your treated like royalty because thats where airline industry votes usually come from. But fly in cattle class and its a different story. I think the strategists for this airline should be told what a poor service they are providing to the general flying public. Only reason they are popular is because they are cheap (for economy) and they have a virtual monopoly on doha airport.
Q15_R17_C7 Bad
geez... i hope that by the time i join them; i'd be able to make a difference and not be one of them... i hate bad customer service!
Q15_R17_C8 Good
QA flies non stop from Doha to more destinations then any other airline. Skytrax has voted QA cabin attendants best in middle east and 2nd best in the world. It is a comparatively young airline; mistakes are made in process but comfort of non stop travel and frequency that QA has is a great service for residents of Qatar. I was flying with BA on a 8 hr transatlantic flight and I had made special request for food (they were advised week in advance) but guess what no food; had to eat peanuts for more then 8 hours.. Does that mean BA is a bad airline; no its not but these things happens. All airlines have issues with delays and all are working hard to minimize them; QA has better on time performance than many big name airlines. I hope your next flight with QA is on time; if not then call airliner (Qatarliving Member) he works for QA I think Beast666

Q15_R23_C6 Bad
just a thought.....the poster apparently enquired about his fiancee's salary not because he is too bothered about it....he is concerned about her career as much as she is and does not want her to quit her good job in india and end up with a lowly paid job for HIS sake.i don't see anything 'wrong' in that. and a family where both husband and wife are working is definitely better in today's day and age coz the quality of life will definitely be better than when only the husband is the bread-winner.gives the woman a feeling of self-confidence and independence and a feeling that she is not being a burden for the family but is being a shoulder;alongwith her husband;to bear the burden :-) this is just my personal opinion.
Q15_R23_C7 Good
i think its better to apply first and get into the interview. and get the offer. after all this she may ask H.R. those Questions and clarify. i believe the salary is 3700 QR (with out flying hours) with flying hours it MAY reach 6000 QR to 7000 QR as long she is single she cant live out of company accomodation. but if she is married ; yes she is allowed to live out of co. provided accomodation.

Q15_R30_C3 Good
It's a really crappy company; divided and having problems with their staff; and they treat the stewardesses really bad. Latest news is that a memo was circulated last week that bans the stewardesses for doing anything than staying at home when on standby; and that they need to get 12 hours of rest before each flight. This leaves them without a social life. The administration and and management treat everyone like garbage - in Europe this would be impossible but here its the way it is; they can always get some more Indians or Easter European. In the lastest 6 months 25 - 33 % of the staff has resigned or been fired so they always need new people. Salary wise it's ok - staff wise it sucks big time - I took the blue pill and found myself alive in Qatar - wish I had taken the red and stayed in Europe
Q15_R30_C4 Good
I heard similar news as Vasquez regarding cabin crew. But for office position it depends on which dept & managers you are working with (=luck).

The thing is because of the ratio; most girls in Qatar get that immediate self confidence raise.

"Qatari ladies; were never been allowed to marry any foriegner even to any arabs; so why wonder? Qatari Ladies are born to marry Gulf men only. but i know one; The father of the lady is half Indian; and the father; arranged a marriage to her for an Indian Groom but i am not sure if the Indian is allowed by the government to stay here or even live here...the lady is Qatari; her grandmother was an Indian. But many Qatari men are married to an Indian ladies...i know alot. "" There's nothing we can do to change the past; if it teaches  you a lesson profit from it then; forget it."""

Q16_R51
My wife and I are moving to Qatar in October from The USA (Texas) SHe is a bit concerned on what is proper dress for women. We have been told that anything is fine as long as her sholders are covered and her knees....She is very upset about having to ""cover up"" when its 115' degrees outside. What is acceptable?"
Q16_R51_C1 Good
"As a woman here in Qatar; I encountered the same problem when I moved here last year...I was told ""long sleeves and long skirts"". That is not entirely true; esp. in the summer when the heat is unbearable. Your wife can wear capris (knees do need to be covered) and short-sleeved tops as long as the neckline isn't too low. The benefit to long summer skirts is that they are actually cooler than pants. The general rule is that it shouldn't be too tight or two revealing. Also; keep in mind that they run the A/c on high everywhere; so your wife will probably want to keep a cardigan with her to wear around on top of short sleeves when she is in restaurants; malls; etc. You are arriving in October; so the weather will be fine; like spring weather in the States; very pleasant actually. Last winter it actually got quite cold here; so bring jackets and even a light-weight winter coat (or heavier if you intend to travel during winter). One other option: a number of western women do wear abayas aro....."
Q16_R51_C2 Good
surfcatgolferdude. cover up is not normal here for expatriates. covered shoulders and covered knees is not a must. Let your wife relax. Think of it here as a conservative western country. The rule is to protect herself in a way that she does not dress anything that could be very very revealing and tempting some horny guys to bother her. very trasparent trousers or shirts or blouse is not rcommended. very very short skirt is not recommended. Welcome to Doha
Q16_R51_C3 PotentiallyUseful
I agree with Kelly here; for expats; its alright to wear sleeveless (well; considering the weather here now) and skirts……just don’t show more skin than usual And of course; If you don’t want to draw unnecessary looks from guys/lookers here; it is very intelligent to cover up…you will see what we mean when you set foot here… basically; everything is acceptable as long as you don't draw too much attention with what you wear..
Q16_R51_C4 Good
"Your wife can wear just about anything she wants as long as it is decent. The muslim ladies are totally covered up; cos according to Islam; the beauty of the woman is for her man only. I recommend that she wear ""normal"" clothes; this is totally acceptable for ""western ladies"". And at a club or at home anything. But when you go around to a supermarket or shopping mall I recommend she wears a little more covered up. This is not because of the Islamic point of view; but more for her own protection. Don't forget; there are a lot of men here that do not have their wives with them; and sometimes their eyes are falling out by looking around.... if you get what I mean Aisha-Taweela"

Q16_R59
Sorry for the ignorant question; but I need to know before I move to Qatar if wearing makeup is frowned on or not. I've heard nothing one way or the other; but I thought it might be considered immodest for the same reasons as displaying the body or hair (like it is for traditional nuns). I only wear a little makeup; but I don't want to look like a ""painted lady"" to anyone."
Q16_R59_C1 Good
I believe that no matter how hard you try; you won't ever be able to carry off as much makeup as girls here do. So don't worry; nobody will think you look painted :^) In fact; when I arrived here; I felt I wasn't wearing enough makeup!!

way too much eye liner and foundation. CanÂ´t understand why; arab women are gorgeous and have wonderful skin.
Q16_R59_C4 Bad
All I wear is mascara; a little foundation; and subtle lipstick (no eyeliner or blush). I'm glad to hear that I won't have to give up my makeup. I had wrongly assumed that since the Muslim women cover their hair and bodies to shield their womanly beauty from all men but their husbands; then they would also not decorate their faces in public. As you can see; I'm very ignorant about the Qatari culture. I'm very grateful to have the nice people on this board as a source. Thank you!

I've found no matter how hard I try I will never surpass Qatari women for fashion sense. I don't find the women here stare at me because I'm not dressed modestly enough; I find they stare at me because I'm not dressed fashionably enough! The teenage girls I used to teach teased me because the scarf I wore to the school (It was a strict Islamic school) didn't match the rest of my outfit. They also insisted that I didn't wear enough makeup or perfume.

Nara Salon is on Al Waab Street (same street as Villagio). It's about 300m from the Teyseer petrol station as you head toward the new junction. My wife owns it. I think it's about QR60 for a regular manicure and QR80 for a regular pedicure (she's not here right now so I can't ask her); and they also do haircuts; hair treatments; make up; facial treatments; waxing and threading; and henna art. You can call 44478008 for an appointment - there's also a mobile number for the manager (Joanne)33843371 and if you want to see some pictures there's a Facebook page (just search for Nara Salon). Right now they are also having a sale on Makeup Forever products. If you tell them you heard of the salon through me (Steve) you should get a discount on treatments as well. If you do go; please let me know what you think as my wife is always looking for feedback on improving the salon and services.

Go inside the building like you would for Mega Mart; but go right; past the Jewellry stands and where LG/Jumbo has their store. The Foot Centre is right next to it. Same company as the one in the City Centre. I do not have their number but you could call the shop in the CC and ask for the number. Both places do male & female and are professionals in the care of feet. They sell the Dr Scholl products & shoes too.  Do make appointment  Aisha-Taweela

Try aminexil from Vichy. It won't grow your hair to the heels but alt least it will keep it on your head. Unfortunately the hair loss problem is genetical so all this remedies have a limited effect.

It is a good treatment; coz minixodil will cause new hair to grow; but the problem is you might get unwanted hair growing on your body like the face; arms or legs.this is its drawback

Get checked out at the doctor; if you have too much Testosterone this is a side effect (hence 'male pattern baldness' in the over 30's). The other contributing factor is diet; eating properly is important; a balanced diet without junk food which contains 'empty calories' in other words lots of calories but no vitamins or minerals. Don't waste money and valuable time on pills and potions sort out the cause not the effect. Its like waxing your car when the engine has no oil in it; it doesn't help; wastes time and money (and the engine still seizes)

Steve is 100% correct It only works for the person who created it. (money wise) Saw palmeto pills and nettle tea work way better and they are cheaper. In most cases people lose their back hair because of DHT hormones. You need to block these hormones and the only way to do that is by using pills that target prostate related issues in men (like saw palmetto); which is like hitting 2 birds in one rock ..

Rizks; not forever.. you always can undergo hair transplantation.. Steve; sometimes it's inherited..

I&#39;m moving to Doha soon; for five months initially; though it&#39;s possible I may settle long-term. I&#39;d like some advice on any good gyms in Doha. I can&#39;t seem to get any comprehensive information on the net. I&#39;d like a pool; sauna; gym; and a climbing wall would be a big plus. Any ideas or recommendations. How much would it cost? Thanks for any help you can give me.
Q18_R6_C1 Good
there are a couple of 'pure' gyms i know of SAS Gym and Gold's Gym (this one you may not know of it unless you are American) which cater for the gym freaks ... the latter gym i believe is spoofed in Dodgeball (w/ Ben Stiller and Will Farrell) However; there are a few that are health clubs which is what you are after in your description they are:- Al Dana Club Diplomatic Club Doha Club (but closing soon) and clubs in major hotels Intercon Ramada Ritz Sheraton etc plus Al Sharq Ritz Carlton opening soon and some other hotels I think most are pretty full. Prices for singles range from 3000qr to 8000qr per year appr. Do not know of any with climbing walls. Can I ask do the numerous stadiums have gyms that can be used. Also; somewhere like Aspire; can you use any of the facilities there? PLus; many housing compunds have all these facilities ... the quality depends on the compund offcourse; some are real nice such as Mirage; Al Fardan; Beverly Hills; Tbah etc some not so.

Now Gold; has no sign up; no admin and its only 459 ryl's a month; plus the same stupid compulsory personal trainer deal. 12mth's will be round 5900 ryl's.

Hotel gyms are just not what is needed for those folks that truly want to work out and not just be seen or use the pool/facilities. Hmmmm; now you have me thinking again....

Q18_R28_C6 Bad
I was actually considering opening a gym too! And hiring proper personal trainers unlike the crappy ones they have here that don't have a clue what they are talking about and rely on needles in the butt to gain size.  Hotel gyms are for suckers; they don't have real equipment for people who are serious about working out.  They don't even have proper machines for cardio to allow one to mix up their routine.   The only problem in Qatar is you would have to own the land as renting it could be SUPER expensive. Another problem is idiots who misuse the equipment; and leave dumbells scattered all over the place. 
Q18_R28_C7 Good
who already have land..and as far as picking up after folks..yes..but that happens everywhere...and is part of the staff's job. The gym equip at Sheraton is actually quite a decent variety; and hotel gyms are basically the only choice with the exception of Golds..but for me that would mean driving completely across town to get there. But...still; to have a gym that has everything/everyone necessary; would be pure heaven... As far as those that use steriods; etc. to gain muscle..those guys have always reminded me of the old cartoon character Atom Ant...HUGE body with a itty bitty head...in fact; I always end up laughing when i see them..and I know they can't figure out why.

Q18_R28_C8 Bad
I know several people with land; but remember in Qatar it must be land designated for commercial purposes; and those usually have high rent value; I doubt anyone would be generous to give to you for free! Just saying. Correct it is the staff's job to pick up the weights and re-rack them; however they don't usually do it here often; well at least not at my gym. They are too busy following around some sheikh and showing him 'secret tips' and ignoring their job. Every time I go it is a mission for me to find the other dumbell from a missing pair.

"No; over a 100 classes per week; I do not think so. Aspire; maybe. The market here is rather small and classes are difficult to sustain as a lot of people are here on a temporary basis; work 6 days per week hence simply do not have the time to attend classes. Consequently professionals; which are often to expensive; are not being hired. Most professionals work on part-time basis; or as a hobby. What you describe is what we call ""HOTELS'; they have all facilities. Sharq Village might come close to what you want; Aspire may be moving in that direction.

Thomas; Some of the newer apartment compounds have gyms in them. I've seen a very nice gym setup in a compound off of Salwa. I haven't been to Gold's Gym on D-Ring; but I understand that you can get 10 single day passes for 370 riyals (roughly $10 US per visit). I'm not sure what the full membership fee is; but $10 per trip sounds high when gym memberships in the states could be obtained for as little as $35 per month. Yearly memberships can be bought for access to hotel facilities; but these may be fairly pricy too. If money is no object then looking at hotel memberships is probably where you'll find the nicest facilities. Some hotels may offer day passes so that you can check things out and compare. European Family Club (Garvey's) has gym facilities; but I haven't made use of them as of yet (Individual memberships are about 800 riyals annually and family 1200 I think).

Just for exit purposes; you can stay in Bahrain airport and wait for your doha business visa. Pls. Be sure about that business visa.

Hi; My colleague has done this trip and he had this to say. This is the instruction to drive from Bahrain to Doha. Reverse the same for Doha to Bahrain. -Its around KM. 430 one way; and it will take minimum 5 Hours including immigration stop. -First; you need to take Saudi visa and put it in the passport (which will be return visa); then you go to Qatar embassy to take Qatar visa based on Saudi Visa. -I can not say whether it is safe or not ; but you need to go during the day because there is KM. 125 stretch which is from Ehassa to Qatar border which is one way road and I think it is a little risky when you drive at night.. -Do not take a laptop with you or any private books because they check every single folder in the laptop which it will take long time ;and they will confiscates all the books that you have. I wish to know about the insurance on my car during my stay in Qatar. I intend to do this trip in this month so do let me know if anyone has done so. Hope this is of help

Q19_R27_C5 Good
I was reading this article yesterday... I agree with Hummers...the Bahrani minister - had me laughing. 1. Expats (it referred to asians) dont adapt.... how can they 18 to a room and 600QR a month??? 2. With all due respect Gulf culture is very closed and based around family socialising..fine but we don't have our families and we mingle with friends of both genders. He complained about cultural erosion... ehhhhhhhhhhh who goes to Bahrain for sinful weekends???? I think he should see that it is his neighbours not expat workers and infidels. 3. It also stated that the economic development didn't create the jobs appropriate for gulf nationals - eh what does that mean? 4. It isn't economically feasible to kick everyone out who has been here 6yrs it would be disastrous for the economy. It all seemed very ridiculous to me and I can't see it happening in Qatar soon.
Q19_R27_C6 Good
I don't think it's feasible to kick the expats out of the Gulf; because the locals still are not sufficient in numbers to cover the demand for work positions. I also think that measures such as establishing maximum residency period of 6 years will be a disadvantage; because many comptetent expats will have to be replaced by others.

Q19_R27_C8 Good
The problem with this measure is that it assumes that by rotating the expat workforce out every few years you can somehow slow or eliminate the erosion of local culture. When your culture is so closed and you are outnumbered 5 to 1; then I don't think rotating the foreigners will help guard your culture. Add to that the exrteme dependance on the foreign workforce; and the Gulf will remain in trouble for some time to come (imho of course). Stay safe all. Perfection does not exist. The question therefore; is: what level of imperfection are we willing to settle for?

Q19_R35_C1 Good
Your biggest problem being you have a south african passport my friend is in the same boat! If you are on a business visa then the answer is yes if you want to leave the country you HAVE to have a exit visa if you are on a visit visa then no you do not but you will need a visa to get into Dubai!

So you will be on a business visa until your RP comes through all you have to do is tell your company when you are going and they will apply for a exit visa which is just a piece of paper really saying you are allowed to go and they will also get you the entrance visa for when you come back! You can go wher you like just remember to check if you need a visa for the other countries you wish to visit! Also make sure they have done your business visa before you fly out so it is sorted for when you land!

Q19_R45_C9 Good
We just recently travelled by road going to Bahrain and passing Saudi Arabia. All you need to do is to apply for a Saudi Visa in any of the authorized Umrah Travel agencies. Visa for each passport holder costs 150QR and you need to submit along a copy of your passport; marriage contract and an Arabic no objection letter from your company which includes the plate no. of the car you're going to use to travel. It is not that dangerous as long as you make sure that your car is perfectly in good condition to avoid breakdown along the way. Yes it is way more cheaper than air travel.
Q19_R45_C10 Good
I have heard things about going by road to Umrah. Take this Tip seriously. If you are planning to take Umrah trip; go with 2-3 families as people already adviced nu others and if you are going alone; never stop your car in the middle of nowhere; when you see any arab guy signalling you to stop your car for some help. i heard of lately; that some people stop the car and once the driver gets out of the car to see (what happened); then suddenly; they will draw any weapon and ask you money; take your car; take your belongings or worse.. So if you are going alone; stop only in Fuel station or Hotels and not any other place. if needed; to stop your car; don't get down. I hope this tip will be useful for you.

Q20_R20_C8 Good
You won't get an approval if your husband's salary is below 10;000...the reason behind it is you cannot live comfortably if your whole family is with you; and the head of the family earning only 5;000. Way back 2007; the limit is minimum 7;000...2010 onwards; they raised it to 10;000 due to higher cost of living. You cannot add wife's salary to make the 10;000...

You are very lucky Kabayan to be considered your joint salary to sponsor your kids here. This is the first time I heard such case was approved. Good luck on your plan to transfer under husband sponsorship.
Q20_R20_C10 Bad
To be honest; they are lenient when it comes to children's sponsorship. I know somebody who only have 3000 salary; but managed to get sponsorship for his kids...unfortunately; this is not the case for husband sponsorship.
Q20_R22
Hello; My husband is currently sponsored by a company. He has been working there for the last 5 years. He asked for a release; but his manager refuses to give him one. I am also sponsored by my company separate from my husband's. Can I switch my Husband's sponsorship from his company to mine so that he can leave his current job and pursue something else? We thought this may be a work around to the situation he is in. Thanks

I am an UK national and have a great position and great pay; thus i don't believe that will be a problem. I can sponsor my husband that is not a problem. Would he be able to work at his current firm under my sponsorship; or apply for a new job. If he gets a new job; he can transfer from my sponsorship to his new comp. I know people who came on wife's sponsorship and looked for a job and transferred thier sponsorship to thier new employers once they got a job. But that person did not have a job or previous sponsorship. Our case is different; cause he has a current sponsorship. Only reason why we want to switch is so that he can have some freedom to choose. This whole release thing is like torture.

I have gone through same situation where I couldn't get release from my current sponsor.

This I have confirmed from the labour department as well. Or if you find a way then let me know :-)

We are having issues with our maid and we may let her go. She is under our sponsorship. What is the process of letting her go?

Q20_R34_C4 Good
NOC IS No Objection Certificate and releasing an employee that way and applying for another maid visa will be difficult for you as the Labor ministry will question about why have you given a release to an already approved visa; and then applied for the same post.The best procedure for you ; [if you intend to bring another maid that is] is to cancel the visa; sent her home and reapply for a maid visa;you also need to provide evidence about the status of your previous maid visa.

Q20_R34_C9 Good
"you cannot just ""let her go"". You have 2 options only: 1. to find another sponsor for her and to make sure she has transferred her sponsorship properly. 2. to cancel her RP; and then she has to leave within 7 days. Make sure she has left by dropping her to the airport personally. In any other case; if she got caught here without valid RP; you will be in big trouble."
Q20_R34_C10 Good
Minoush; if you are not satisfied with her; you can give her the option of looking for another job here in Doha; someone who can sponsor her; and then give her the release and let her go; this way she doesn't stay without a job. For this she can place an ad looking for a job with a willing sponsor. She will surely get one. You can also send her back home as well if you are not satisfied with her work.you are not compelled to keep her; just make sure that she is paid all her dues; but to be on the safer side; check what your contract with her states and do the right thing.

I believe they are different and also it depends on the company whether they allow you to transfer your sponsorship to someone else name without exit or send you back home and you have to come on new visa. At least this is my understanding. I have gone through a process of NOC earlier in Saudi.

Hi; I contacted a nursery teacher who was looking for a job and i offered that she work as a nanny for my kids; 8 hours daily for 5 days aweek and she asked for 2500 QR monthly. She also asked if i can give her a work visa. Is this a reasonable price? and is their a difference in the salary if she is on my sponsorship and living at my house or if she is on somebody else sponsorship and live out? please provide your advice as soon as possiple.

Q20_R45_C3 Good
she is trying to rip you off. a live-in maid is paid in the range of 800-1500 these days. this lady wont be staying in and she wants you to sponsor her as well. she is crazy and you will be even more crazier to accpet her offer. what k9 said is true...but thats an altogether different issue. sometimes you got to work and leave the kids in a trusted person's care.but i would also add that there are some extremely lovely maids/nannies who take very good care of the children.it all depends upon how we treat the help and how they do in return. i suggest you contact recruiting agencies here who get the maid for you...the initial pay is high...but thats it. you can have the maid on your sponsorship and have them on trial basis too; if you are unhappy they change them for you. else just apply directly for visa and then go about hunting for the nanny/maid.in short indian embassy has kept the minimum pay for maid as 900;philipino is 1200 and indonesian is in the same figure...i think it is 800......
Q20_R45_C4 Bad
Thanks han 19; The informatin you provided was helpfull. I just prefer to have a live out nanny and someone that is already in qatar so i can get to meet her before she comes from another country and be on my sponsorship. anyway; thanks for your help
Q20_R45_C5 Good
if its a live-out nanny...even then expect to pay in the range of 600-1000 for their services. another thing you need to be sure of is to have their passport copy with sponsor details with you.becasue sadly most girls are runaways and that can be a real issue to keep them with you. girls on free visa are free to work without any hassles. anyway if you do find anyone and you dont wish to keep her...let me know....i too am looking for a maid.....but i prefer a live-in maid for a month to look after kids n housework......they should know english or hindi. happy heart drive safe because someone is waiting for you at home

Q20_R45_C7 Bad
chunk since she worked in a nursery...she shouldnt have a problem finding a job in the nurseries here.there are a couple of good ones here. alternately she could find the right job as a nanny with the right family.the figure that was mentioned in the initial post is something only the real rich can afford for a few hours a day. once she is here..she can always post her services here and someone will surely help you out.but be prepared to accept that the way things are done here are a little different from back in england.i dont htink she will have a problem getting a job here. happy heart drive safe because someone is waiting for you at home

I agree with what you are saying.I do have someone working with me at the mentioned rates.However the quality of services provided are awful.Its just that I'm too desperate since I have a kid and I am working. In case anyone finds any other option let me know even if it means a good nursery.

I am the one who opened this discussion when I asked for advice about a nanny. I don't think pur wife will finda problem in finding work at nurseries in Qatar; sice there is alot of british nurseries here and there are always new nurseries opening. However if she was unable to find a suitable job; please concider working with my familly. I have a 15 months old twins; who are nice and calm and I would apppreciate it if I found someone reliable to take care of them; I am not looking for a miad; but for a qualified person who will be able to take good care of the kids; teach them new words; stimulate their senses; etc. And I am willing to pay a good salary for the right person. so feel free to contact me if you are interested.

Hello; Could anyone help to clarify what sponsorship law is about? I only have a vague idea that it restricts you from changing job once you are working for a company in Qatar.

Q20_R59_C3 Good
You cannot change employer for the first two years which is normally the minimum contract period. You can change employer only (after you finished your two year contract) if your previous employer issues you a NOC or no objection certificate. Otherwise; you have to exit the country and have your new employer issue you an entry visa. That is my understanding of the sponsorship law as explained to me by some of my friends. I may be correct or wrong.

Q20_R66_C7 Good
Alphy; since her Work visa was rejected; what make you thinking that switching any other type of visa to Work visa will be easier? You misunderstand the process. MOL doesn't know where the perosn is. They don't even care whether the person is here in qatar or back home. They either ISSUE a work visa or they do not! Once the Work visa is approved and issued; then either the person is coming to Qatar (if he/she is outside of qatar) or switches his/her present visa status (tourist/family/business) to Work visa. But the Work visa must be approved and issued in any case regardless to where the person is. So it absolutely doesn't matter where she is. You will only waste your money and time bringing her on tourist visa and getting rejection of her work visa again. Does your compnay have a quota for indian female in the first place? it is very difficult to get nowadays..
Q20_R66_C8 Good
It is very hard to get work visa for South Asian and Southeast Asian ladies. It is best to get her a Family Visa and get work under your sponsorship. All of our recently hired ladies are husband-sponsored since the company could not get work visa for 'single' ladies.
Q20_R66_C9 Good
The answer is NO. There's no such thing as NOC from hotel visa ok? hotel visa is valid only; based on your stay in the hotel in Qatar. That's it. If you want her to come here in Doha; it is either you sponsor her(from your company); or complete her CV and submit it to companies which has vacancies. Some companies(ones they accepted the application of the employee) shoulder the visa from the country of origin; ticket to Doha; etc. That's what I did. I'm not sure why your company rejected her application. Maybe you should try other companies. Goodluck! Ciao.

Where do I pay a speeding ticket fine? The www.moi.gov.qa website says that I got my picture taken last month. I've heard that ""most people don't pay fines until they come to sell the car""; I've also heard that the fine gets increased by 10% for every month it isn't paid. I'd rather pay now. Thanks!"
Q21_R71_C1 Good
You used to be able to pay it online at the e-Government site but that's been under maintenance for a long time now. Go to the traffic department either at Madinat Khalifa or Airport to pay. You need to renew your car's road permit once a year. That's when uou have to do a traffic violations check before they renew the permit. Fines don't increase. You just have to pay it when your road permit is up or if you're involved in a car accident; they check for violations then.

Go to Traffic police near the airport. It is convenient and faster than Madina Khalifa. Been to both places and know the difference.

Coming along Airport Road heading to Wakra turn right at the traffic lights that used to be Parachute Roundabout. About half a kilo up the road on your right.
Q21_R71_C7 Good
I've been there only once; but I can't remember the place. It is kind of tricky and not that easy to be found. I tried to post earlier but I was disconnected and it seems that my post is not here. Man you can pay at any time but before renewing your car registration. When you go for that they will ask you to clear all the violations that you got. First time I hear about the 10% thing; might be a new thing but never hear of it. The guys are right as well as the Airport one is less crowded than the Khalifa branch. You can also pay for that in 'Giant Stores' or 'Villagio' as I remember. I saw an office there for the Traffic Department. There is also in 'Hammad Hospital' down there near the Parking area down there. It is empty all the time. Good Luck
Q21_R71_C8 Bad
Taking it from this side is ok; never been there for a long time. The first and only last time was from inside the old airport street. That is why it was kind of tricky. :)

He didn't tell me he was going to fine me! And is the online payment service at www.e.gov.qa ever going to come back?!

I’ve got a loan from one of the Bank here in Doha and I have credit card which all amount are consumed. I have been terminated by my company and I will not get anything nor settlement from the company. Will I be able to get out of the country? I mean will I be able to get exit permit? And what will happen for my loan? Please advise.?

Already answered to your question on the same. May be the bank will waive off the balance interest but you have to pay the actual amount
Q22_R17_C2 Bad
Related to your Question i am agree what Aasghar said? You Have to pay actual amount?
Q22_R17_C3 Good
the bank is insured so if u are terminated the bank will get the money from the insurance company after deducting what ever is there in you bank balance. there is no meaning for not allowing u to go out on exit coz u have no source of income.
Q22_R17_C4 Good
For your company to cancel your visa they need a bank clearance letter. Obviously bank will not issue any until you settle or claim from your company (your end of service benefits). Insurance does not cover CC payment; it covers only in a death or permanent disability; not for loosing your job. So no chance of leaving the county without a settlement of CC.

The insurance covers loss of job in case of cost cutting due to financial situation of your employer. If your current sponsor is your guarantor; then they will be charged what you owe. If they can't pay; your loan insurance has to pay the bank.

If you have the letter; you have to take this along with your passport copy; original ID as well as a photocopy; with photos; go to CID office in Azizya; hope you know the location - if not - here is (direction - from Decoration R/A go to third r/a and turn right and first right; on your left you will see the office; go to building No.1 or 2 not sure; please get it confirmed) they will take your finger prints and the documents; you have to pay a fee through your card; no cash is accepted.

Dear Maji08; They did not ask you because being a resident of Qatar; you must have already done your finger print for your RP; which is saved in their comuter records.

Take employment contract and go to the Labor Dept. They can force the company to pay the back salary and with pressure from them you would be more likely to receive NOC.
Q22_R42_C10 Good
1. Normally the ban period in case of resignation & cancellation of VISA is 2yrs... 2. But incase of your wife; she can ask from her company to issue NOC to her stating that her company won't object while she transfers her company visa to husband visa..There is no need for her to even exit QATAR.. Incase; if her company doesn't willing to give her NOC and no transfer of VISA; she can leave QATAR and can come back on HUSBAND VISA provided that you(husband)should meet all the norms and criteria that is normally required once applying for FAMILY VISA...You should be earning a salary of around QR7000 or more than that..

Q22_R43_C5 Good
according to the Qatar Labour Law; Article 54 In addition to any sums to which the worker is entitled to upon the expiry of his service; the employer shall pay the end of service gratuity to the worker who has completed employment of one year or more. This gratuity shall be agreed upon by the two parties; provided that it is not less than a three-week wage for every year of employment. The worker shall be entitled to gratuity for the fractions of the year in proportion to the duration of employment. The worker's service shall be considered continuous if it is terminated in cases other than those stipulated in article (61) of this Law and is returned to service within two months of its termination. The last basic wage shall be the base for the calculation of the gratuity. The employer is entitled to deduct from the service gratuity the amount due to him by the worker.
Q22_R43_C6 Good
service gratuity is granted minimum of 1 year continuous service in the company. the computation is like: gratuity=last basic salary X 70% (this is 21 days) X length of service in years
Q22_R43_C7 Good
example: last basic salary: QR10;000 length of service: 5 years {10000 x 0.70} X 5 = QR 35000 note: 21 days or 70% is minimum requirement from labour law. If your company gives you more than that then its very good!
Q22_R43_C8 Bad
Yep; that's the law. Now; go and fight for it. Because the law is one thing; and reality is the other thing.
Q22_R43_C9 Good
1. Last basic salary (multiplied) by 12 months (year) and (divided) by 365 (days in year). = X 2. Years of Service (multiplied) by Agreed Gratuity (days in a year)= Y 3. X (multiplied) by Y = Z (Total Gratuity to be paid) Sample: Last basic salary = 10;000 x 12 (months) / 365 (days in year) = 328.76 (average daily salary) 5 (years of service) x 21 (agreed gratuity) = 105 (days) 105 x 328.76 = 34;519.80 (Your ESB from employer)
Q22_R43_C10 Good
example: last basic salary: QR10;000 length of service: 7 years {10000 x 0.70} X 5 = QR 35000 note: 21 days or 70% is minimum requirement from labour law for 1st 5year. After 5year continuous service employee is entitled to get gratuity minimum 30 days each year service put in after that period. means first 5year employee is entitled three weeks of basic salary each year;after 5year it will be 30days each year. {10000 x 1.00} X 2 = QR 20000 Total 7 year =55000 QR

Will POEA accept this contract for the processing of my EOC?Ive done already the VISA stamping ang other requirements and this contract is really my concern? Please need help...thanks!:)
Q22_R58_C1 Bad
kailangan na verified ng POLO-OWWA Qatar ang e.c. mo.
Q22_R58_C2 Bad
So what will I do now?and is it really a long process to undergo for the authentication in POLO/OWWA?should I send back the contract?
Q22_R58_C3 Good
If you have got your Visa stamped there is nothing to worry.
Q22_R58_C4 Good
signed contracts need to be authenticated first by POLO here and I think you need to go through local agency there
Q22_R58_C5 Bad
wmsj... really??so it's ok for POEA to process my EOc eventhough the contratc is not authenticated by phil embassy there at QATAR?
Q22_R58_C6 Bad
lupin... you mean; i have to find an agency to process it again?and does it take long process??do you think?? oh no...
Q22_R58_C7 PotentiallyUseful
because direct hiring procedure now was stopped by POEA and if you want to exit legally/documented you need to go through their procedure.
Q22_R58_C8 PotentiallyUseful
grace; it's OEC (overseas employment certificate) not Eoc...
Q22_R58_C9 Good
grace; you will not be allowed to pass the immigration at the airport (NAIA) if your documents are not valid and processed by POEA... and bear it in mind that POEA will not process your documents unless you go through an agency...that is now the LAW strictly being implemented in the Phil.... recently; a lot of filipinos tried their best to come to qatar but they were always stopped at the airport due to strict implementation of the said new LAW... so i advise you not to take the risk and follow the legal procedure to avoid facing problems at the airport... it will be very disappointing on your part to realize that you will not be allowed to embark the aircraft because of incomplete documents...

Think twice befor moving. Doha has almost no night life and social life is very limited. It is a very conservative society ! there is one liquor shop and its very expensive. UAE is much better.
Q23_R7_C10 Good
Social life is pretty much dead here. Any club/bar you go to; you will have plenty of Indians/Pakistanis/Bangalis/Nepalis/Philli and local guys hitting at you........ May be you will like it............but maybe not. The only choice is to create a small but decent social circle of your friends and socialize at their place/club houses; etc.

aquila: Welcome to doha and Ql family We ql members meet every thursday; location we can pm you if you would want to join us
Q23_R11_C4 Good
seriously though; I would look for a club that interests you. Most of the country revolves around shopping and work; but everyone likes to get a bit of a break. If you go to school then Im sure there will be a good number of younger people there; but I havent heard of any places to meet people; though Ive looked a bit. Personally; I go swimming and smoking sheesha at waqif quite a bit; but there arent really a whole lot of people to meet at either. Unfortunately; I dont think this place really caters to us younger people; though at the end of the month there's going to be a tiesto beach party; so maybe you could meet some people there.
Q23_R11_C5 Bad
Aquila lets go out together someday!! IF you have reached your legal age of partying..lol
Q23_R11_C6 Good
Aquila - we are in the same position; we came over from Toronto about a month ago and have been looking for things to do. It's definitely hard to meet younger people in Doha; people really keep to themselves! We got active on this site as it's an easy icebreaker - definitely come out with a group from here sometime! A bunch of us took a trip out to a remote beach yesterday and had a BBQ; it was great! I'm sure there will be more events coming up so keep your eyes peeled. You definitely have to put yourself out there to meet some people locally (be careful as well though - use your judgement - make sure you meet up in a public place with guys AND girls). My wife and I (young couple!) are always up to do anything - if you want to go for a drink or go shopping or something sometime drop us a message!

Q23_R28
Is there any correlation between loneliness and being honest?
Q23_R28_C1 Good
Here's a simplified correlation: Be Honest and tell the truth no one wants to hear.. And since no one wants to hear the truth; they believe you're just insulting them or taking a shot at them. Thus they ignore you.. and if such people in your life are all around you; they eventually start ignoring you thus leading to you feeling lonely. Sad fact of life; but true. But if its about you; I believe you shouldn't change. Be the person you are... and if you have to change; change for the good.
Q23_R28_C2 Good
Simple and Straight Be your Self...
Q23_R28_C3 Bad
better being honest ! it is simple & straight as i go with flying ace !
Q23_R28_C4 Good
Human beings; as social animals; need to be tell lies in order to survive. If you tell the truth; people will hate you for who you are. Therefore; you may flatter them with lies. The more you flatter; the more chance of them including in their social circle. On the other hand; if you bluntly tell the truth on their face; the more chance of them ignoring us. In my opinion; such kind of social behavior is called hypocrisy. Darwin's 'survival of the fittest' theory can be applied here.In other words; hypocrisy is a basic survival instinct.
Q23_R28_C5 Bad
and loneliness? one thing is for sure loneliness is part of human life; like happiness everything has it's own time..time to be happy time; to be sad.. time to rain; time to shine Honesty depends on you if you use it to yourself or others while it may result for being lonely or happy.
Q23_R28_C6 Bad
are you saying that honesty and loneliness are not related?
Q23_R28_C7 Good
they're different.. Being alone is good at times; while Loneliness at any time isn't good... I still maintain that there is a correlation between Honesty and Loneliness; but that depends on the samples... for eg: if u keep company of people who are insensitive to you; then surely you will be lonely coz they won't understand you. Likewise; if people appreciate your honesty; there is no reason why you should feel lonely. As a generalist statement-yes; there is a slight correlation between those two.. but if you look at it subjectively; then there's lot more to explore in studying the correlation.
Q23_R28_C8 Good
Well; there might be some connection between these two in certain situations; but in general; there is no direct correlation between loneliness and honesty.
Q23_R28_C9 Bad
well put.
Q23_R28_C10 Good
Relation between these two independent variables are open to interpretations..could be this way or that. The thought was a random one; so let it pass off :)

hello! if your cat is spayed; i dont think she is looking out for mating. unless she was spayed recently but all that signs will go away in about 2--3 months maximum. try to find out what she likes about being outside. may be trees; may be the birds or may be something else. this is going to be a bit hard; but if u know here well; well then it would not be easy in finding it.. dont try to cage her all at once inside the house as she has been both indoors and outdoors; it will surely affect her and she would probably meyaw the l-l-e-h out of u; but make it a step by step project. you may need to keep your windows and doors closed at all times to make her stay inside. but give her sometime to roam out too; as it is what she is used to. yet reduce the time of staying outside pattern vise. i think it is natural for them to go outside as cats are really curious. mine has been inside the house through out their lives and they love love loooooooooooooooooove watching the road through the wind.....

Q24_R54
KLM have told me my Yorkshire Terrier is able to travel in the cabin with me from the U.K to Doha. Has anyone done this? 2 pet relocation companies have told me I cant and Im unsure whether they are telling me this to avoid getting their fee or whether I have been misinformed by KLM. Cost is not the issue; the wellbeing of our wonderful pet is.I really want the most stress free method of travel possible for her. Can anyone help.
Q24_R54_C1 Bad
dogs are dogs only
Q24_R54_C2 PotentiallyUseful
Dogs go in the hold in special containers.
Q24_R54_C3 Good
Both KLM and Lufthanza allow you to bring pets from the UK (via Netherlands or Germany) in the cabin. The pet plus the carrier has to weigh under around 8kg (which should be fine for a small breed). Price is surprisingly minimal - it is a fixed excess baggage charge of around £70 (check with airlines). The pet has to be transported in a carrier which fits under the seat (really only during take off and touch down). There are special soft carriers which have a tent-like squashable roof which will fit under the seat and spring back up. The brand that springs to mind is Sturdibag. Good luck! Btw I was told about the airlines by Doha Vets (who were amazingly helpful) and then checked directly with the airlines in the UK; who agreed with this...
Q24_R54_C4 Bad
Thank you so much for this information Tiddsmum. Have you had experience of animals travelling this way yourself? I had checked with KLM who said exactly as you have; however when 2 companies in the U.K told me this was not allowed it left me feeling very deflated and wondering if it was maybe Doha Airport that dont accept dogs travelling this way. She is our daughters dog but is a very special part of the family and keeping our teenager onside for this move is very important. I really appreciate your replying as I have tried to obtaining this through other blogs; websites to no evail; all say cargo; excess baggage in hold. I will also contact Doha Vets who may be able to help with import certificate and help upon our arrival.
Q24_R54_C5 PotentiallyUseful
Yes; call Doha Vets. They can clear this up for you; good luck! It was my impression that only Lufthansa and maybe KLM did this. Mandi
Q24_R54_C6 PotentiallyUseful
Get in touch with Dr Khaled El Hossan (khaled@dohavets.com); he can sort all the paperwork out this end. The import licence is valid for 1 month; but it may be worth finding out how long it takes to get one in the first place... All you will need to do is sort out the export papers from DEFRA at UK end - this is the link to the relevant contacts: http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/tradeexports.html Oh; here is an example of the type of carrier: http://www.zooplus.co.uk/ask?q=sturdi+bag&num=20&form=search&gclid=CMbG7c2d468CFQt66wodhz7NwA This is all theory - I had been planning to bring out my elderly cat (who would have been too stressed in the hold); but as we are not staying in Qatar; will now not need to do this. Hope it all goes well for you and your daughter's dog. Have to say though; August is an awfully brutal month to be bringing the poor thing out there; hope it doesn't have a full coat!
Q24_R54_C7 Good
Oh; just double checked my facts: pet + carrier has to be under 7kg. Time to put your YT on a diet????? The airline website will give you the maximum dimensions of the carrier (but do not be put off by the height restriction; as these special carriers squash down to the maximum allowed height ~20 cm I think)
Q24_R54_C8 PotentiallyUseful
I don't think that YT will qualify under this scheme; remember the weight of the Pet+carrier has to be 7kg or below 7kg!
Q24_R54_C9 Good
Yorkies average in at 2-3 kg; my cat is 4 kg and these carriers are designed to be super light; for this exact purpose! Bar chiuauas; I cannot think of a lighter dog. It's worth pursing anyway and DohaVets and the airlines are experts on this; so don't be disheartened. You don't get anywhere without trying....
Q24_R54_C10 PotentiallyUseful
I'm on a roll now - if you check the link I posted; the type of carrier you will need weighs in at 900g...to go over the recommended weight allowance; that would have to be one hell of an obese Yorkie !!! ;-)

I was thinking of sending my 2 year old there-but i heard a few uncomplimentary things bout the nursery lately...so would like some feedback on the same.....
Q24_R80_C1 Good
He was in the older class. They did lots of activities in the morning. They did turn the TV on in the afternoon. Half the kids were asleep then and so it was to keep the others quiet while they waited for the moms to come pick them up. They also had educational computer games for them to play if they did not want to watch TV. I thought the teachers were just fine and really doted on the children. I was happy with the place.

The best way is to speak to your employer prior taking such step and elaborate your circumstances.

Hi; Im working in Qatar for more than a year. I started in the company last July 2010; now I want to go back to my Country for personal reasons. I submitted a resignation letter last sept 6 with a 30 days notice. I inform also on my letter that my last day in work is on Oct 6. Is there any way they will not grant my resignation? Thanks for the advice
Q25_R47_C1 Good
if you are on a strict 2-year contract; then it means that you are resigning early which has a somewhat negative thing against you. But if you have been good with your work and your more than 1 year stay had been fruitful to the company; it will be much easier to negotiate or talk with your management about your inetention. The worst that you can encounter is BUY your own ticket. But if you have a one-year renewable contract; then you have the right to go home with your just benefits!

Flor I don't believe what you are saying. The law only says you must provide 30 days notice; otherwise they could deduct the equivalent of that salary off your end of service entitlements.

Article (49) If the service contract is of an indefinite duration any of the two parties thereto may terminate it without giving the reasons for the termination.

Q25_R47_C8 Bad
Thanks Mike. Thats also what I've known thats why I gave a 30 days notice. My only concern is what if they will not grant my resignation and I already have a ticket.

If they will not accept my resignation what is my other option to go back to my country? Tnx
Q25_R47_C9 Bad
Thanks Mike. Thats also what I've known thats why I gave a 30 days notice. My only concern is what if they will not grant my resignation and I already have a ticket. Another thing; I have my own working visa when they hire me and the plane ticket coming here in Qatar was from my own pocket; they hire me as local. If they will not accept my resignation what is my other option to go back to my country? Tnx
Q25_R47_C10 Good
"and as you quoted; the employer can deduct any equivalent amount....... But if the contract is 2-years; then the corresponding amount may be more than expected. That's why I said; he may shoulder his ticket as he has not finished his contract. And since it was late that he mentioned that he was locally hired; the another consequence arose unless specifics were placed or indicated in his contract. But I fully agree with you about the notofocation periodas we all are under contract! Again the magic word is ""DEPENDS"""
Q25_R53
Hi! I am currently working in a company here in Qatar for just a month. I haven't taken medical and finger prints yet. Now one company is offering a good deal. And I want to transfer there. My question is if I'm going to resign from my current company and exit to my country with an exit permit from that company; can I come back here in Qatar and accept that job offer of the latter company? pls advise!
Q25_R53_C1 Good
if your residence permit has not been processed and your company does give you exit permit; then you should be fine. But - I am not too sure if they wouldn't ask for NOC - I guess it depends on what visa you came here on. Maybe someone else can advise.
Q25_R53_C2 Good
If the residence permit is not processed yet in this case you can exit and then come with the other company who will offer you job; but if it is already processed from the first company then it is a problem
Q25_R53_C3 Good
no need anything ; u may go back and come with new work visit visa.
Q25_R53_C4 Good
IF YOUR WORKING VISA IS ON THE PROCESSED; THEN THAT WOULD BE THE PROBLEM; YOU HAVE TO REQUEST AN NOC AND IF NOT; THEN THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR YOU AND YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO YOUR COUNTRY BUT BE SURE YOUR NEW COMPANY IS WILLING TO HIRE YOU IN YOUR COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY WILL SPEND MORE MONEY AND YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR SOME TIME FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR NEW VISA ONCE YOU ARE HIRED OVERSEAS.

However with my current company the visa is already on my passport; the white sticker I think;.. so i can exit and come back to cancel that visa? and no need for any NOC? how about ban? pls advise Thanks!
Q25_R53_C7 PotentiallyUseful
I think in this case your best bet is to ask the immigration / labour dept directly
Q25_R53_C8 Good
That sticker will be on all passport and the important thing is you should check with the mandoob or immigration direct if it is processed or under processing or not yet and if processed then you can not leave and even if you leave you get a ban of 2 years and if under processing it means the same as it is processed because it is undergoing and if not processed then you can leave and check with your mandoob

you were on Business visa. man solve it wise way not right way.

A couple of things you need to know... If you arrived here on a business visa from Phil; and then you went on to your company sponsorship; then you are not classed as a local recruit. So... your employer does not have to give you NOC. Next thing... even if your employer gives you NOC; you will be able to transfer your sponsorship to another employer for at least one year. The rules as I know are that you should complete 2 years with your employer before you can transfer. But; normally after a year Labour will transfer the sponsorship Think about this twice before you go ahead. Hope this helps with making your decision :o)

Free visa means...work visit visa...its 3month duration and tranferable option....must be a sponser for this visa and has to give NOC for the transfer to any other company.
Q26_R35_C8 Good
lymisaj; you are giving false information to public; as others mentioned there is no Free visa; there are some people selling few visas by their influence with Sponsor and allowing him to work outside (illegally) and none of the company will appoint you unless you have proper visa; once you got a personal sponsored visa you cant change your visa for another 5 years and within this time you are working here illegally and if they catch you you will be in jail and will be deported. If your visa is under any company you can chage after 2 years. Always good way; apply for jobs in Qatar with your qualification; now a days most of the companies are getting business visa under their company and later you can change to work visit. Some times Free visa holders stuck in this country and you may never meet your sponsor after you arrive in this country and may not get Exit permit to go for vacation or Emergency situation.

If you enjoy filipino cover bands and lots of asian variety in the crowd then the Qube is GREAT; however if you enjoy more of the western flair you are down to Garvey's; Rugby Club; and Rydges. Of these your best bet for Fri and Sat night (my OPINION; so no flames from anyone) is going to be Rydges.

Maybe even Cairo for that matter. Or go to Goa; India if you wanna spend Xmas at trance parties on the beaches. Or go pub hopping in Bangalore.

Were going to do add again but through contacts in the building and info from our pervious add campaign we found another nanny. It has been about 6 months now and all is good.

We have play dates arranged each week for the nanny to take our child and we have other expectations that we hope insure a nuturing and healthy day. There is good and bad to both senerios.

Is Tipping customary in Qatar ? What is considered ""reasonable"" amount to tip : 1. The guy that pushes the shopping trolley for you 2. The person that washes your car 3. The tea boy that makes coffee for you in the office 4. The waiters at 5-star restaurants 5. The petrol pump attendants etc"

Those people dont earn much salary and ofcourse they are expecting you to give something for they side money( for lunch; transportation; etc) Give at least 10% of the price of what you eat..or give reasonable amount..and even better if you give it from your heart without bitching. hehehe
Q26_R77_C2 Good
Tipping does not appear to be customary among the local population. The people who perfom the tasks you have listed typically make between 600 and 1000 riyals per month; when that's the going rate for labor; one might surmise that Qatar is not home to a culture of conspicuous generosity. I suggest that you go with your conscience; bearing in mind that anything you give will probably be put to good use. With the exception of the car washers; none of these people have any control whatsoever over the prices of the services that they perform. What they can control is the service itself; and I generally use that as the basis for my own calculations.
Q26_R77_C3 Good
For the car wash; since it's usually 8 QR; I tip 2 QR For restaurants; I check to see if the tip has already been included in the bill. If it hasn't and the service has been good; I tip about 15 - 20 % of the total. BTW; hotels and some restaurants usually add a surcharge that is NOT the tip so check your bill - you might think tip is included when it's really not. For the gas attendants; I normally give about 3 QR when I fill up the car (it costs me about 30 QR to fill up). For the tea boy; I'm assuming the company compensates the person adequately - I haven't been here long enough but I would leave a tip at Christmas and special holidays; something like 100 QR - this also goes for the security guys at my compound. If someone pushed my cart and loaded the groceries into the car; I'd tip about 5 QR (if someone has to push my cart; it means I must have a ton of groceries). I haven't tipped the person who bags the groceries since I'm unsure about this one. I don't know the salaries of th.....
Q26_R77_C4 Good
These guys don't get paid all that well really. I keep talking to office boys; cleaners and my houseboy quite often. Some of these are paid as low as Qrs. 450 per month. Infact; I know of our ex-office/tea boys; their company failed to renew the contract and they were jobless for couple of months. It isn't their responsibility to renew the contract obviously; but the sponsor penalised them by paying just Qrs. 100 per month until they could find another contract elsewhere! I think we are all lucky and should be thankful that we're paid really well when compared to these guys. I know few would argue that we are educated and we deserve to be where we are. But little generosity won't affect us much. 1. The guy that pushes the shopping trolley for you A: I PUSH MY OWN TROLLEY; IF SOMEONE DOES HELP ME I PAY QR. 2/- PER TROLLEY. 2. The person that washes your car A: MY HOUSEBOY WASHES MY WIFE'S CAR. WE PAY HIM A FIXED AMOUNT; BUT ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS; WE PAY HIM QRS. 50 OR 100. 3. The tea boy.....

Don't forget; for many of the service people in restaurants; it is the restaurant that gets the tip not the server.
Q26_R77_C6 Good
its like spreading the love!! I tip everyone i can; and we all should. I tip the guys who pack my bags about ten qr once a week; tip the guys who put petrol in my car like 5 - 10 qr; never had anyone push a trolley for me thou - thats what my arms are for! tip in resturants too;thou not fast food outlets for some reason ( does anyone tip there ?) we should all tip those who can afford to; people earn very little out here and no matter who you think you are that could be you one day; so treat everyone as if you know them when you are dealing with them in these situations! And always say please and thank you too; you would be amazed how few do!
Q26_R77_C7 Good
I usually judge of the quality of service recieved. Unlike many place except in Doha people don't tip as often as they should. Now probably back home when you got out and do the shopping someone bags your shopping with a smile (and not a grumble) walks you to your car with a smile (and not a grumble)then you tip them well. Personally... if they just to do it for the sake of getting a tip off an expat and you hand them over 2 riyals you'll still see tham standing there waiting for more?!

Hello Everyone !!! I am a recent graduate engineer with no work experience. I have been offered a post as a trainee ELV engineer. I will be earning 1500 QR per month for the training period of 3 months after which i can expect a salary raise. My question is; will I be able to survive on 1500qr a month ? Considering my official accommodation is going to cost me 700qr per month (i will be sharing an apartment with 4 others). Hope to hear from you all soon !!!
Q26_R83_C1 Good
i do not know your situation or the details; but sounds very low..even if they do give you a raise after 3 months; i doubt it'll be more than 1000..so its low and you'll have trouble making ends meet..if you smoke; eat out and pay for transport; there's no way you'll manage. Best of luck

"After a long long disputes over the originality of the perfumes in the souqs; me and my friends agreed that they are original!!! We bought several times from souqs and compared them to the ones in malls and finest shops...guess what ? same same. Problem is some times the perfume itself is not long lasting; so you would think it is not original but if u buy from 51 east it will be the same also; short lasting. Also my boss went there and he saw the original Purchase invoices and it was from MODERN HOME ... same resource to all perfume fancy shops in doha. The story is in souqs they will profit something like 30 QR per bottle ; but in 51 east and other fancy shops they need much more than that !!! Also if u went to AL ANSAR GALLERY in city center you will find middle price between souqs and fancy shops ... why ? because they need less profit than fancy shops but more profit than souqs..

Mariecor- when i asked my little sisters what do they want for Christmas; they said anything would be fine... I told them that i am just going to send them my kisses and they said yuck! lol... little kids! Kidding aside.; I know material things are not important this Christmas; but I guess it's just me; I get used to it; giving gifts on christmas is part of the tradition that i grow up with... It should not be expensive though but i guess something that is memorable or appreciated by the receiver.

damsel; my nieces & nephews don't want the kisses as well. They don't want me to buy anything for them either. But they want money so they can buy what they really want most. The kids are really funny. We always say we dont want anything for an special occasion. However; we as receiver; would be happy if we receive something that is memorable; as you said. Actually; I am still searching for something that will be appreciated by my husband...but I'm sure; it is not in your list. Selecting gifts for men is not really that easy.

If you haven't been to Doha before; you will have to be ready for some adjustments. Since this is a Muslim country; Christmas is celebrated mostly in private. It is not a public holiday. If you are a Catholic; there is a midnight mass here. Just check the schedule. Private dinner party/gathering is how most Christians do it here. There are also some hotel/restaurants that schedule events during the day or the eve. The same goes for New Year. Most locals and other muslims are very tolerant about Christians celebrating Christmas; some even join the New year celebrations. Just be well aware of the limits and keep your respect of the local culture.

Q28_R37_C1 Good
I've only been to one; but if you mean dull as dogshit when you say down and dirty; than I guess thats right. The parties are separated into two groups; men and women; and there is no alcohol (at least at the womens parties) they dance to loud disco music and dress scantily for other women while critizing what every other woman is wearing. Not exactly the greatest party of all time.

Doha girl?? are u calling our weddings dogshit??? the least u can do is show respect in the country ur in!!!!!!! by the way.. u can't judge weddings here by attending only one!! im a qatari and i attended SOOOO many weddings and this is how it is here..

NO MIXING..if u want alcohol and what ever u have in mind then find what pleases u somewhere else!!! scantily dresses u say.. as i said u cant judge all weddings by just one.. it depends on the wedding and family.. oh and whats wrong with dancing 2 loud music?? dont u do that every now and then just in a diffrent place!!

You sit next to him for the traditional coffee and tea; have a picture taken with him. Later on there's a buffet and an ""'ardha"" which is a traditional sword dance. Very nice; beautifully decorated garments. After that groom goes to the women's party and joins the bride. At least these are my first-hand observations. There's no ""down and dirty"" part there."

You will find that migration agents are usually in Australia. If they are in Qatar they may specialize in migration for many countries. If you use a migration business from Australia there are full service agents that you would speak with over the phone or email. They will be able to give you personal advice about which migration visa to choose. There are now lots of migration business's doing a DIY (do it yourself) process where you pay around $400 and receive an ebook that tells you how to complete the migration application yourself. Personally I consider this a ripoff to pay $400 for a book. I found a site called http://www.migrationinternational.com/ and they do a thing where you do not pay up front. They claim to personally do your application while chatting through email. And you pay once they have finished. I live in Philippines and I think I might use this site as I don't pay up front and at least they complete the application rather than me. What does everyone else think?

Hi; Can you make your valuable comments here. Who exactly benefit out of it with the existing rules on NOC; 2 year work ban and an exit permit for every overseas travel? How do you think Qatar's reputation visulised by other Middle East countries; Europe; Asia and rest of the world?
Q29_R51_C1 Good
Qatar's reputation To Europeans - Big fat dude's with heaps of money To Asian - Source of income To other Arabs - kinda pain in the A** To me - I like it

Q29_R51_C3 Bad
Our comments are not valuable. Qatar govt does what it likes as it has lots of money. Who cares what you think.
Q29_R51_C4 Good
These rules came to exist out of need to protect employers and secure the country. These needs still in place.
Q29_R51_C5 Good
Hi Tinkerbell10; Your comment seems to originate from utter frustration. As you might have observed; in many aspects Qatar takes Dubai as a role model where such exit permit; 2 year ban etc does not exist and therefore the world love that place. Qatar; while trying to attract international attraction eventually has to remove such bondage rules. For example; the employees can keep their pass ports but they cannot exit the country without the consent of their employer sounds like an irony. If people come to work in Qatar on a 2 year contract; they should be given choice to renew or switch to another job after successfully completing the contract. I hope the perception of Qatar Govt will change eventually to catch the international attention..as a moderately free place.

Q29_R51_C7 Bad
Hi Tinkerbell10; Slavery in one form or the other existed in several parts of the world from time immorial. But those days ideas of globalization; equality; freedom of speech; right to information and service were also not there. I fully agree with what you have mentioned of the malls ans labour camps. But someone has to voice such plights to the public in some reasonable way. At least that we are discussing this issue now.. may be some one else would discuss this in another plat form where there could be a wider audience. Thus I think you and I can do something for the society if not a fundamental change.
Q29_R51_C8 Good
Hi Moza; Definitely you can make a real difference. We can see now Qatar Govt is supporting many nationals in getting educated sending overseas through Qatar Foundation if my understading is correct. That means by and large Qatar Govt would welcome better ideas though slowly..
Q29_R51_C9 Good
Qatar will change and for the better; remember how far Qatar has come in just 15 years. Yes it has the money to do it but it has taken other countries 500 years to change this much but they didn't have to swamp the countries with foreigners to do it. Imagine living in your own country and being outnumbered 8 to 1 by foreigners. That is not an easy change. Slowly things are getting better but don't expect overnight change to benefit your individual needs.
Q29_R51_C10 Good
International pressure will make Qatar change not us even if we voice it out in some public forum. Definitely there are some things that needs some changes here but the government has said that they are going to do it. Just a matter of time. Hopefully sooner than later.

I have no idea what hotels you are talking about; however you must be staying in the cheaper style hotels. Where did you visit when you went to Australia? the outback perhaps? Australia does not by any means have the extravagent hotels they have over in some countries with gold foyers and marble fountains but they certainly have clean; polite service. Sure some may not be up to scratch with industry standards like every country I am sure... These are the places that you should take note of and inform the industry board; especially if their star rating does not match their service. In regards to Australia being dirty and rude I have no idea where you are getting your information!!! I myself am Australian. I am very clean and easy going person who is happy to help out and talk to people. Yes we have some dangerous animals however what place doesn't? You speak of dirty? What about all the sand storms and dust that covers our cars every day here; causing coughs and colds!! I think you need.....
Q29_R52_C6 Good
I haven't come across dirty hotels; but yeah you get far far less for your money in Australia than any other place I've traveled to. Almost all hotels are rip-offs. Nothing comes close to the luxury of Middle Eastern hotels or the value of Asian hotels. On the other hand Aussies are great at marketing and advertisements make budget backpacker hotels look like 3 star hotels. Almost every mom and pop run bed n breakfast has a very flashy website and most are even featured on popular TV travel shows.

The visa on arrival fee at Dubai Airport is AED 102/-. You should purchase an Electronic card of AED 100/- from the Bank counter for which they will charge AED 102/-. There is one Visa Application form (available in front of the Bank counter) which is to be filled and submitted to the counter with your Passport and the Electronic card you bought. They might ask for your ID. This charge is not increased as I am travelling very often to Dubai using Visa on Arrival.

Dear all; I will be moving to Qatar with my family quite soon. I will be working in Ras Laffan and have been offered housing in Al Khor. Can anyone tell me something about Al Khor as a place to live with family (2 kids aged 4 and 6). How about schooling; facilities; entertainment; living conditions and environment? Can my wife easily find a job in Al Khor? Is Al Khor a nice place to live or should I insist on accommodation in Doha? KR Van

I don't know much about AlKhor bu I think it will be better if you stay in Doha especially that you have kids and they need to go to a nice school which I doubt you will find a nice one in Alkhor. Ayman

Hi Ayman; Is daily commute from Doha to Ras Laffan feasible and is there accommodation to be found in the northern area of Doha? WV

I think you will find that the housing in Al-Khor is first class and that the schooling (English) is of a very good standard
Q31_R12_C4 Good
Al Khor is a nice quaint little town...and it has a beautiful corniche
Q31_R12_C5 Good
The Ras Laffan Housing Complex in Al Khor is quite good (if that is where your staying); there is a nice beach there too. However; it is an extremely small town and really only used for the oil and gas industry. You would probably find your self coming to Doha on the weekends. See if you can stay in Doha as it is only a 30 to 40min commute in the morning.

hi; I'm going to move to Alkhor soon;as I've been offered a job with qatargas....Can you please tell me what is it like for singles? Many thanks
Q31_R12_C8 Good
The school in Al Khor is good; well-equipped and has a happy staff. In fact everything for the expat community is well-equipped and there's a very nice club with a lot of social activities; besides lots of home-partying. Neverthless; it has a sleepy feel which can irritate and some of the teens; I gather; get a bit disgruntled. Playing the singles game might be tricky. Imagine a very orderly English suburb with no pub and a 60 minute drive to the nearest bar or off-licence; but with plenty of dance classes and bridge tournaments and stuff. Many people love it; some can't stand it.
Q31_R12_C9 Bad
Interesting comment mr Niceguy. How far away is Al Khor from the Doha? What about housing; are they affordable? What is the name of the school? Is that the only school or are there any other schools within commuting distance? many thanks
Q31_R12_C10 Good
Prices; I don't know. All the foreigners I know in Al Khor live in 'The community'; a large compound between Al Khor proper and Ras Lafan which has one school; and one social club etc. I had thought housing and club membership was provided by the various employers. It's about 40 minutes drive from the North end of Doha to al Khor. Warning! I don't live there; though I have visited and have pals there.
Q31_R22
Ok guys I am going to prehaps ticks someone off again but I have a question; not Sunny but me. Will a Qatari man go out with a western Christian girl; have sex with her and then move on because he think women from the west are wild and sex craved. Sunny has received quite a bit response from Qatari men who want to date her once we arrive; I even got an offer myself. But I believe it is a trap and I tell Sunny be careful. Any advice out there?
Q31_R22_C1 Good
It is a very rare Qatari man that would want anything more than what you just described. It is a very rare man in Qatar that wants anything more to do with a Western girl than you just described. Meeting men here is like stepping through a minefield. 9 out of 10 of them just want sex. And they will do and say anything to get it from you. I am not bitter; I do not hate men; but I have been living in various parts of Asia for the last 2 and a half years. Trust me when I say if you do not want to get burned be VERY careful who you date. Asian opinion of Western women is not very high when it comes to sex and dating. Tell Sunny to stop advertising online for a date and come here and get the lay of the land first.

Q31_R22_C3 Good
I must tell you redcajun504 Arab youths can go to any extent to get sex; but so is men from any country. Men have always sex on mind. It is always advisable to be cautious. But why are you worrying? There is a huge expat population here; which includes Indians; Europeans; Americans and even Australians. So; it's not a problem basically. Ask Sunny to be prudent and approach the things casually; without any pre-conceived notions; though caution is utmost required. You never know you may actually get a gem of person among these Arabians. After all; many of them have married Westerners. But dohagirl as such is correct that youths here always look for sex. On my own experience I must tell you they see Russians; Lebanese and Filipinos as someone always available for sex. Actually; this part of the world has many prostitutes from these communities; thronging star hotels. Use your common sense and things will be cozier for you. I wish you and your sister best of luck. Ambrish (ambarishjha@gmai.....
Q31_R22_C4 Good
Life is not easy if you are a Western Woman; and the main reason a man from this part of the world would want a western woman is mainly for sex. However; please do not for one moment think that the men and women here con't have premarital relationships - they do it just not talked about and it is not caried out in the open. Due to the conservative background of the boys they will always return to their families and it would be vry difficult for them to marry outside the families would not be happy about it. I think it is much better to be very cautious out here although there are a great many handsome men and they can be very charming going through the Arab and Asian world of men they are all interested in SEX. One of the things is that being found to be together whoc ae not married can get into very deep trouble here - just a little food for thought.
Q31_R22_C5 Good
Sadly this has been the case for many years. Maybe it originally stems from the days when arabs had loads of money; visited capital cities (mainly in the West) and were naturally surrounded (as they were rich) by hookers. Word spread when they returned that they had been with western women. The assumption would then be made that all Western women were loose. That is the assumption that we came to many years ago. Rather like the Western men going to Thailand

Thanks dweller..You have been fair.. DG..your point is sensible..I tried to see if the shoes fit on the other foot..and its same..Ironical?? (LOL...) It is a very rare Western man that would want anything more than what you just described. It is a very rare man in the West that wants anything more to do with a Asian girl than you just described. Its impossible to believe that the thousands of crippled shaking 70 year old Western men moving with 21 year old Asian beauties do so...because the guy was so romantic; loving and responsible that the girl fell head over heals in love with him.. I have seen Western men in various parts of Asia for the last 2 and a half years. Trust me when I say if you do not want to get burned be VERY careful who you date. Western opinion of Asian women is not very high when it comes to sex and dating. Here I actually mean women from China; Phillipines and Thailand..Easy prey for western men..In other countries South Asia and Middle east women are not availabl.....

argh; not this! Right; misconception clear-up time. Bottled water in many cases is just bottled tap water. Nestle's brand over here; and 'oasis' from dubai; is just bottled tapwater; nothing else. Tap water contains chemicals. Yes it does; thankfully; otherwise it wouldn't be water. It is made up of the elements hydrogen and oxygen; which are chemicals. It may also contain trace elements and a small abount of chlorine to prevent bacterial growth; boiling tap water will remove the chlorine. Bottled water is safer. Don't be too sure; Mineral water can only be classified as mineral water by the EU if it has had nothing added to it; that includes anything that will disinfect the water; which WILL contain a small bacterial culture.

Here is a zero tolerance policy towards drugs and penalties for drug trafficking include the death penalty or life in jail. Penalties for possession or use of illegal drugs include imprisonment and heavy fines. Qatar has issued a warning to visitors to be aware of its strict laws against illegal drug possession. The presence of illegal drugs detected in blood or urine tests is considered possession. You may also be charged with possessing drugs if trace amounts are found on your body; clothing or luggage. Amounts of 0.05 grams or less can lead to guilty verdicts. Medication available over the counter or by prescription in your country may be illegal or considered a controlled substance in the Qatar. .

I guess thats the BEST package that Qatar has to offer. If they can house you at the Medical City (with shuttle bus service to work) then it will be the best.

Q32_R24_C4 Good
If the company has available visa for your nationality; teh2008 is right you can get it in a day or two. But there are factors why your visa has not been released yet; e.g. the PRO is lazy; the PRO is on vacation; no visa approval yet; the position is on hold; other internal factors from your employer or agent etc. Better confirm again with your agent in the Phils. to remind the employer:)

I also have several officemates before here in the phil who are now working there. I hope i can find a way to cut-off my expenses and i will really tighting up my budget to save.

But nevertheless im still young and probably find better opportunity whenever it possible.

As far as the reputation of Al Fardan goes; it has a very good reputation in Qatar.

hi guys! just want to have an idea on how to live there in qatar.. im from Philippines and ill be assigned there in New doha intl. airport as a site technician. with offer of 3400qr + 600qr(allowance) is it enough for me?my co workers said that 600 is good enough for every month. hope you can help me out for the cost of living there.. il be there on or before sept1 2011.. guys pls help me.. give me insights guys on how to survive there...
Q32_R36_C1 Good
The cost of living here is quite high; but whether your salary is enough would mainly depend on your lifestyle. Other factors; such as whether your company would provide you with accommodation and transportation would be very important as well. If you have to pay your accommodation; from your own pocket; then I'm afraid your salary would not be enough.
Q32_R36_C2 Good
You will be provided with free accommodation and transportation. These things costs a lot here in Doha. 600 Allowance; I think it's enough if you will prepare your own food; cost of living in Doha nowadays is very high and I prefer to make it 1;000 (food; personal items).

Q32_R36_C4 PotentiallyUseful
yes; they are right.. 600 allowance is not clear.. is it accomodation/housing allowance? food allowance? transpo? If this is for housing; its not enough..i believe the 600 allowance you mentioned is for food because usually here; employers provide transpo and housing..
Q32_R36_C5 Good

from Where i can test eyes for driving license? How much will be the fees? Need to go traffic dept ?or private 1 is enough?
Q33_R72_C1 Good
Go to traffic department in Madinat Khalifa and pay 30 QAR.
Q33_R72_C2 Good
any private no problem. inside al rayah drinving school; inside lulu hypermarket etc. cost is qr30/-
Q33_R72_C3 Good
Its not necessary to get the eye test done from the Police station. Any private eye testing center will do except that it must be authorised from the police station. You can get it done at the eye testing center in Lulu Hyper market. Its an authorised one and I got it done from there. Dont remember exactly how much it cost me..but its some where between 20-30 QR. Good Luck.
Q33_R72_C4 Good
you will need to go to the Traffic Department in Madinat Khalifa for the eye test. Previously; driving schools like Karwa provides eyetest at their site; but changes in Policies happened. Now; they require it to be taken in Muror itself. ((rule the world))
Q33_R72_C5 Good
Visit Apollo Clinic on Muntaza Street near Doha Petrol Station. They are authorised for eye test for Driving License. Take the report and visit Traffic department in Madina Khalifa for further procedure.

You can start riding; and then they will think of the law. But more concern is regarding your safety. Here people drive cars looking in the mirrors only; and in case they dont see you.... Better wait till you save some more. You will get good used cars from 20;000 QR
Q33_R78_C5 Good
its allow but safty 1st ....
Q33_R78_C6 Good
Yes; I think women can ride motorcycles in Qatar. Check with any driving school around Doha in order to acquire the license. And if you have a western driving license; you can go directly to the traffic police to convert it right away. It will take you 30 minutes. Prices are cheaper than in Europe and more or less like in the states. A good 600cc bike will cost you from 28000QR to 50000 depends on the make and model. Most of the bikes around for sale are either racing or off road but there are a few nice scooters and street city bikes on the market For Example: A Ducati Monster = 40000 A Triumph 675 = 35000 A Harley Davidson Sportster or Nightster = 42000 If you don't like the models available on the market; you can always go to the dealer and order the model you want; just like I did... it will take a couple of months to arrive but it might be worth it. 2nd hand bikes are quite cheap too if you want to consider this option but you need more time to bump into the bike that suits your r.....

"LLC means limited liability company; basically meaning if the business goes under the bank can't go after personal assets.

Starting a small business still needs alot of big contacts ; 1stly a Qatari Sponsor who should be trustworthy enough to start a joint venture with !!and most important is getting a Licenses from the GOV. especially if its food or any retail trade ! doha is still a Raw market for the next 3 years i feel ; so the Gov. should become more liberal on sole business ownership by Expats !

(1) Legally you can't run a business unless you have a local partner; so it depends on finding the right partner.

Q34_R55_C3 Bad
what do you mean? visa processing or visa validity?
Q34_R55_C4 Good
Yes; if they are flying in from the Philippines; the copy of the approved Business Visa will need to be sent to the Philippines where they can finalize the process to exit their country. Processing a Business Visa application in Qatar can take 1 day to 2 weeks; or more... Once a Business Visa is approved; the individual has 3 months to arrive to Qatar before the validity expires. If they do not arrive within 3 months; the entire process must be restarted. Once the individual arrived in Qatar; they can stay for an initial 30 days; extendable twice; for a total of 90 days before they will be required to exit Qatar. Hope this helps!

I had to organise my own boxes which I did from QMart at the Mall; and they put all my stuff into them for me. They were quite careful with my stuff and no serious damage was incurred; but I had to supervise that they packed the fragile items carefully; and instruct them on what to put in each box. I strongly recommend him; but as with any move; supervise that the valuables and fragiles items are packed carefully or even better; by yourself. Also; be on hand to manage the packing.

Then today he rang and said he was outside my place - apart from the fact that I'm working today and he's 24 hours late.... Hardly reliable; so just as well I'm not taking him On the upside; I tried Runway International. They turned up on time; took 10 minutes assessing everything and asking all the right questions... they may be more expensive than Kabeer; but at least they'll show up!

To the Hindu community I was on a visit several years ago to the city of Bangalore in southern India. Region is very beautiful. I am a fan of Indian cuisine; especially Biryani taste was very good there ... I have tried several places here in Doha when I return .. Were not the same taste!!! Can anyone pointing me to a restaurant mastered the art of authentic Indian cuisine? Thank you
Q35_R33_C1 Bad
The topic heading is confusing;; you should change it. Hindu is not Indian
Q35_R33_C2 Good
Try Sanjeev Kapoor's Khazana. But the master chef probably never set foot in this restaurant. So don't expect the original Indian taste. But it will probably be better than the others.
Q35_R33_C3 PotentiallyUseful
The Biryani you ate at Bangalore prepared by Muslims; all other communities including Hindus eat Biryani in Muslim Restaurants. Therefore you have to address them as Indians. To be frank the Biryani you had tasted at Banaglore no where prepared in Doha as per my knowledge

Q35_R33_C7 PotentiallyUseful
There are more than one kind of Biryani in India. The most popular styles are 1)Awadhi(Lucknow) Biryani and 2)Hyderabadi Biryani 3)Sindhi Biryani etc. In Awadhi Biryani the meat and rice are cooked seperately and then layered and then steamed. It's a very complex process which brings out the best fragrances of all the spices without being too spicy itself. The Hyderabadi Biryani is a bit more on the spicier side where the meat and rice are cooked together. Since we don't know which type of Biryani you have tasted in Bangalore we cannot say for certain where to go for similar experience.
Q35_R33_C8 Good
Try the Mutton Biriyani at DOHA ROCKS near the Airport Signal. It is excellent. By the way; they serve biriyani only for lunch. The place has ample parking plus a nice ambience.

Q35_R66_C1 Good
See other threads regarding petshops. My only experience was in one about 7 years ago in Doha; and I have never set foot in one again. If you look at some recent threads you will find many people have had shocking experiences in some local petshops that sell live animals. If its petfood or supplies you are after try Rider Trading; Carrefour; Landmark; etc. Most supermarkets stock pet food and some basic supplies. Rider tends to stock food and even more supplies and will often get particulars in if you have something in mind. If its a pet you are after see threads of dogs/cats being given away.

I have heard that it&#39;s really fun to drive from Qatar to Dubai on the weekend (obviosly if you have a 4 X 4 Drive). My question is do I need to get a visa if I want to go to Dubai if I have a Residence Permit of Qatar?
Q36_R7_C1 Good
Although you can go to dubai and get visa on arrival if you are going by air but road travel is different. You have to pass Saudi border and you need saudi visa. In order to get saudi visa you have to get UAE visa first. Saudi gives visa only after you already have UAE visa on your passport. Hope this clarifies.
Q36_R7_C2 Good
The whole process will take you 8 days. 3 days to get UAE visa and 5 days to get saudi transit visa. count the weekend
Q36_R7_C3 Bad
Holly Molly !!!!! I would drop the idea of driving to dubai in that case. I should go drive in Qatar for 8 hours rather... atleast I don't have to go into the hassle of getting visa But; thanks guys for information.
Q36_R7_C4 Bad
Think twice before doing this. It is at least 8 hours drive (at 140-160 km/h).
Q36_R7_C5 PotentiallyUseful
the drive through saudi is said to be dangerous also -unless you are that adventourous. its easier and safer to catch the flight and get visa on arrival
Q36_R7_C6 Bad
Drive through Saudi is NOT dangerous. The road is absolutely normal; just keep away from trucks. The only problem is total lack of gas stations. However as it has been told here - it is not fun; and the only reason to do so is probably shopping in IKEA.
Q36_R7_C7 Bad
Driving to UAE is a lot cheaper than flying. You save on air fare (specially if there are more than one persons travelling) and then on taxis in UAE. Do what u think is best but it is not dangerous inside saudi. It is just a normal highway.
Q36_R7_C8 Bad
Highway is normal. I think now its a 2 lane track. THere are a few petrol stations when you cross the saudi border from doha. After that the next station is around 150 kms away.
Q36_R7_C9 Good
well for UAE visa you will have to go 3 times to the embassy. But for saudi transit visa just go to the agent and you will get it stamped in 5days.
Q36_R7_C10 Bad
If you look at older maps; there is a land route connecting qatar with UAE. What happened to it? well; one day the saudis decided they would take it over; and did so; murdering some qatari border guards in the process. http://www.arab.de/arabinfo/qatar-government.htm When I lived in Oman; the same sort of thing happened to a piece of land bordering the UAE...which is why Oman is split in two pieces.
Q36_R45
i would like to know whats the procedure to visit dubai and other places from qatar shld we go through all the detailed visa application process or we can just get it at the airport? and is its possible to travel by ca to these plces? is it risky?
Q36_R45_C1 Bad
You haven't got to Qatar yet and you are already asking about going to Bahrain and Dubai??
Q36_R45_C2 Good
It depends on your nationality; profession written on your id card; residency period; and such like. It's always much safer to get a visa from Qatar if you are not sure that you are eligible for a visa on arrival. Travelling by car anywhere will require passage through Saudi; and it's a hassle to say the least. You will definitely need to apply for a transit visa beforehand; make sure all the ladies are completely covered while in Saudi; and the roads there are NOT SAFE AT ALL.
Q36_R45_C3 Good
Residents of Qatar for over 6 months can get visa on arrival at Dubai and Kuwait entry points. Any GCC bound road trip means travelling through Saudi Arabia; so you need a Saudi transit visa. Many Qataris and some expats do it but it's not my cup of tea.

Sadly; companies now only provide excursion tickets for annual leave when previously they provided full economy which made it possible to travel almost free. Yes exit permit or visa from sponsor

Hi; This Ramadan we will be going to Dubai by road. We have done it twice before and have always got a visa on arrival at the UAE border. The difference is this time we will be taking along our housemaid. My question is will she also get a visa on arrival at the UAE border? Thanks
Q36_R47_C1 Good
Iam afraid she wont as she aint under ur sponsorship. Its only permitted for locals to take their housemaids or driver in their sponsorship. anyways; i can be wrong as well. The agency from where you get your Saudi Transit visa can advise you on this.
Q36_R47_C2 Bad
Oops...I didnt know that only locals are allowed. Anyways she is under my sponsorship.
Q36_R47_C3 Good
You will need to get a transit visa for her with a no objection letter to the Saudi Embassy typed in Arabic. You will need to get her a Visa from UAE Embassy here in Qatar before you travel. She will not be issue a visa on Arrival. I suggest just leave her home
Q36_R47_C4 Bad
Thanks UKEngQatar Actually I cant leave her alone at home. When you say you need to get a transit visa; did you mean Saudi Road visa? What is this no-objection certificate? I spoke with the agent who gets the saudi road visa done. He says she will get the road visa; but he does not know about the UAE visa. Kindly reply...

Any one who compares the two cities proves hes hasnt been to one of them. As someone who just came back from UAE last week; doha is not even close to what abu dhabi is right now. No contest. AD has much much much more social/night life; infrastructure is generations ahead; the roads in abu dhabi are second to none; traffic is well taken care of and life in general is much better. Women are way way way nicer and much more social as well. Build quality of the houses is far ahead of what is available in doha and the city is much cleaner; greener and about a million times better organized. As for roads; ill put it this way; i was at the officers club in Abu Dhabi late for my flight. So I told my taxi driver (mercedes e class wagon) to plz hurry to the airport. He was driving at 200-220kph only slowing down to 140kph for the cameras; and drove at that speed for a good 10 mins; and had me at my destination well before time. Roads in Abu dhabi are AMAZING. Abu dhabi is the richest city in the.....

You obviously haven't lived in Abu Dhabi itself. Parking is chronic and parked vehicles often damaged.

Consult a better dermatologist who can prescribe you with the right medication. Experimenting on different medications which are not prescribed for you may worsen your condition. A good diet consisting of a lot of fruits and vegetables may help cleanse you of the toxins in your body causing your acne as well:)
Q37_R69_C5 Good
Like most other health problems; acne treatment requires indvidually tailored approach. You need to be thoroughly assessed. Your age; gender; other comorbid condition you might have; medications you take and several other things. Once all this is established; the severity of your acne problem needs to be assessed: mild; moderate; or severe. Once this is done; you are told about your options. The use of certain medications may be contraindicated in certain circumstance; for example if you are pregnant. It would not be appropriate to suggest you anything like this. It is better to see a qualified physician to help you with your problem.

Q38_R13_C2 Good
So to answer the question; i'm not certain if you are inquiring about Airlines policy or government visa policy.... If its the former; best thing to do is call QATAR AIRWAYS and ask them. If it's the latter; then maybe there's a government agency you can ask? When my daughter was born (here in Doha); she didn't travel till she was 6 months old; but we were told the law was that she had to have a residency Visa within a month of being born....so by the time she travelled she had it. Hope that helps somewhat; and good luck. Stay safe all. Perfection does not exist. The question therefore; is: what level of imperfection are we willing to settle for?

Q38_R13_C4 Good
for the visa; better get it before the travel to avoid furture hassles. but i would suggest that you let the baby grow old a few months more before you take him/her travelling on an airplane. just imagine even an adult do have some problms with air pressure inside the cabin of an aircraft; what more would a few weeks old or a month old baby feel about this? (he/she'll be crying all the way to your destination) if that's the case.
Q38_R13_C5 Good
my son first travel at 4 mths; as soon as he got his RP. Make sure you ready with bottle of milk for feeding during take off and landing because infant have a sensitive ear and the change air pressure in the cabin make the baby uncomfortable.

when he traveled for the first time.... As per doctor's advice and as Novita said; I gave him a bottle of milk during take off and landing...and everything was ok... Just make sure to issue him passport and stamp the ikama (RP) on it before you travel.

hi all thanks for ur valuable comments...........
Q38_R13_C8 Good
i bought my baby girl when she was three weeks old. she is now healthy and fine. i normaly assume the baby can travel after two weeks from qatar airways. you have to feed baby during take off and landing to avoid pressure diffrence. and should keep your hands clean (by wet wipes) before you touch the baby to avoid contamination. visa can be obtained on arrival for the baby.

Q38_R28_C4 Bad
Is the medical exam result always takes 3 working days? beacuse my colleague did the fingerprinting 2 weeks after his medical exam and he said the medical exam result takes 2 weeks. And the only thing for him to know if he passed the medical exam is because he did the fingerprinting process. And is there anyway to know if you pass the medical exam?
Q38_R28_C5 Good
Once you are done w/ ur medical exam you can check w/ the medical commission at least after 3 working days. Just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you'll get to know if its ready or not. For a medical employees it usually takes about 2 wks to have the results done due to other test (e.i. creatinine test) that has to be sent to HMC for investigations. In your case; you are only required to undergo blood test(HIV) & Chest X-ray(PTB); so i think it wont take long that much. Dont you have mandoop/representative for your company? he is supposed to follow up all these things and you can always check w/ him. Good Luck!

If you have questions about your newborn's health; please take him IMMEDIATELY to a pediatrician. There are many reasons a baby isn't gaining weight and not one of these reasons will a massage help! Please; please; see a doctor.

no problem if doc.dischared him with out comments about weight then why are you worried;mostly ladies preffered breast feeding bc its best for kid;after every two monthes inshallah he'll gain 1kg;some time we try to get our baby more healthy and feed him/her unnecesory avoid it;bc its not good for kid.
Q38_R37_C3 Good
I believe constant massage will do. This is the common advice I am hearing from others.
Q38_R37_C4 PotentiallyUseful
Please see a doctor. Monitor the baby's weight on a weekly basis. Your baby is too young for message. The message is meant to relax the baby's muscels once he starts being a little active. Generally from 3 months onwards. If everything is ok. The baby should gain weight naturally. There is nothing to be worried about.
Q38_R37_C5 PotentiallyUseful
This is a medical problem I think. We should be cautious in seeking advise here. Only your Pediatricain can tell you if your baby has a problem or not. Personally; I hope and pray that your baby is fine. :)

mine was only 2.7 kg when she was born. usually; u take your child to the doctor for follow-up check-up a week after birth; they will advise you on what to do. it's a bit early for vitamins; so all you can do is proper nourishment; breastmilk is still best of course...

"newborn babies can be given massages too; you just need to learn how to do it with proper care as newborns are very delicate..

Please; don't take advice from anyone who is not a doctor. If you are genuinely concerned - go back to see your pediatrician. I can guarantee that no massage will enable your child to put on weight.
Q38_R37_C9 Good
My baby is big now; but when she was born wasn't so much. The best solution is breast feeding. I didn't gave her anything until 6 months;not even water. The mother should eat good( meat and vegetables and fruits....this is not the time to diet) because all the vitamines are passed to the baby through milk. Also try to find Vitamine D3 ( it's extremele important until 2 yeards old- ask any pedriatician to recommand you some; but you/'ll have to ask somebody to bring you from outside Doha- here you cannot find) for the bones. You can google it. You'll find the same on the net. Just make sure you don't give to the baby fake stuff. Brest milk is heavenly.

marriage to a local can take up to 2/3 years - along with this process goes tonnes of paperwork and permissions - and then a desk drawer that seems to have a black hole. Qatari's in Government services have nice incentives to marry local girls - they get all sorts of benefits - marry a foreigner they get none - so there's pressure on the Qatari not to marry anyone else. Qatari's marrying outside of Qatar pick up major problems when coming back to the country - problems as large as being jailed if the family are that unhappy. There is no easy way to marrying a Qatari - have a search on QL to find threads by other posters on this matter.

Hehe! Truth is; Asian women are prettier (though not fairer). Secondly; Asian women are trying to escape to the west. Life is easier for them there.

Maybe it's just a coincidence; and asians are not pretteir than western women. Asian; westerner or from east ( whatever) are all beautiful in the eyes of the beholder.... Anyway my husband is british and im from Philippines; his first wife was british ; he wasn't really looking for asians; we just found eachother and fell in love...=)
Q39_R5_C4 Good
Good topic for discussion though... We always want what we don't have... and the very fact that the Western Men are used to seeing the same type of women all around them; makes them want something they don't have; i.e. the small petite asian women... besides; most of the western men have been thru a marriage earlier and then have asian women... reason being-because they are more homely and like being 'stay home moms' rather than pursuing a career in the West. As far as the Asian Women are concerned; yeh the thought of a better; cleaner and quality life; attracts them more towards the western men... I'm talking general over here... to prove my point; try taking a peep at one of the Cyber Cafe's in Manila or Cebu and you'll see all of them women on webcams talking to a wester man hoping something will click. The same is the case for Asian men... most of them would love to have a Western Woman; but having to work their way to get to that and maybe the thought of failing; makes them wanna .....

Why should the women being a stay at home mom have anything to do with it? I feel your scorn and I accept it-Jon Stewart

Coz many of the western guys I know who have asian wives say that they make excellent stay home moms... do all the domestic chores; while the boys just come back; grab a beer and watch TV...

It's such a fact; that in the US they have the mail order brides that are all from Asia... I don't know that for a fact; but I heard something like that... I mean it's like buying something off e-bay or amazon... lol! Also if you see in Bangkok or Phillipines; you always find western males (mostly over 40) there in search for an asian woman to marry... now it's a different story that not all of them marry! ------------------------------------------------------------ 250 QL points and moving up!!!

Its nothin to do with size n looks; it sure does with the money. Also I believe communication problem is there; usually u find the asians with good accent; I'm talkin as in majorities n minority. Also these white chicks are a bit expensive to keep. well but it is common. I had one before; infact i believe they are easier catch... well guys dont get me wrong here; but I'm tellin you this from my experience.
Q39_R7_C4 Good
'Easier catch'; 'expensive to keep'; whew! I wish you could have been more subtle here... Nobody is a 'good catch'; buddy. If you find someone who reciprocates your feelings; the question of being expensive doesnt arise. Chances are; one wouldnt let the other bear everything on their own. Isnt that the basic principle of love? Care and share? Or have i lost it and become too old already?

Q39_R7_C8 Good
How many Asian guys do you see over here; sheer weight of numbers; I would think. Ok but my fiancee thinks its because the asian girls here are more westernised and therefore would have more in common with them. Also there are alot of Asian Girls dating Asian Guys here; perhaps you just don't see them; trust me she is Korean and would know the numbers. Perhaps you don't notice an Asian/Asian couple but notice an Asian white match more because it sticks in your brain. I have seen loads of Fillipino Couples out together; and I am told that Fillipino girls would much rather go out with Fillipino boys here as they have more in common and are not just trated as sex objects which we know many Arab guys do.

Q39_R9_C7 Good
without government approval of your marriage; you won't get a family visa back into Qatar; unfortunately. Marrying you out of the country can cause major problems for your fiance; so I would suggest you wait until your marriage is approved. The only other option is that you relocate somewhere else; marry there; but your marriage will not be valid in Qatar; and you will have no claim to any inheritences if god forbid; something should happen to him. Does your fiance not have some Wasta; that can obtain your release from your company? I am not saying that will make things any easier; since you still need to have the govt approval for marriage; but at least you can be in Qatar; near him.

You often see mix acquaintances an Arab guy and Asian girl for example. I have friends who were in the same situation; you know people who is in the same thing; as for arguments sake…. having a boyfriend or a girlfriend means engaging in active sex. What if a police comes to you 1 day and tells you that; you were under surveillance for a while and they concluded that you are in a relationship. And for that you have committed a crime.

Of course you get some cases where parents are not brining their kids up properly and they try to disrupt the school. But trust me; it’s always dealt with. Yes it's expensive; but that’s a different story. Please doesn’t bad mouth the School; if you are not happy find another school?

Park House School has a very good reputation and there seem to be many parents who are happy about the education that their children are receiving. As a teacher myself; I am pleased that good girl loyally defends her school; but taking your child elsewhere is simply not an option in Qatar; where many schools (Park House included) have long waiting lists. I would have thought that when parents have genuine concerns about any school; the right thing to do is for the parents to discuss these issues with the teaching staff or with the principal or both.

There is no conductor in most buses; even the ones in which small kids travel; and even after complaining to the school many times; there is no action. Many buses are hired and are driven by irresponsible drivers who dont care about anything. Another issue is the school building..which has been sooo long under planning and fund raising stage.

It is late in the year so a good school will be hard to locate for you child in the autumn term. But it is sometimes easier for older children.

I am going to work in Mesaieed... Does anyone know anything about living in Mesaieed ? Transportation in Mesaieed? Activities to be done in Mesaieed? Is it a real city or just industrial zone? Does i have to buy a car?
Q40_R54_C1 Good
mesaieed is more like an industrial zone. Qatar Government try to develop it and move more people to live in there. It started by moving bachelor people who work for QP living down there. as far as i know they have 1 groceries shop under Shop Rite; 1 thai noodle; some other small shops. And if you do going to work for QP ... the medical centre and dentist in mesaieed are superb. Much better than Doha. i would say you will still need to get your own car to be mobile.

Thanks alot novita77 ... but what about living in the communities ? Is living there good or what ? what they look like? I will be taking a single room? is it a room in a multistory building or is it a single carvan like room? what does a car cost? say like Mitsubishi lancer or Toyota corolla ? Thanks alot
Q40_R54_C3 PotentiallyUseful
kingtout ... i am sorry i cant help you in that department. My husband commuting Doha - Mesaieed daily; so we have no idea about the acommodation. about car hire ... do search the forum ... people have asked alot of question about it before.

Salwa industraial area will be shifted to mesaieed very soon [img_assist|nid=50852|title=hmm|desc=|link=none|align=left|width=|height=0] I would rather have one rose and a kind word from a friend while I'm here Than a whole truck load when I'm gone
Q40_R54_C5 Good
"kingtout; the accommodation will depend on your status (married or single); your company; and your grade. For family there're multistory flats building or independent houses (2 bed room or 3 or 4). The residential areas are ""very quiet"" and relatively much safer; compared to big cities like Cairo (I think the population is less than 30;000; at least up to now). If you're living there as bachelor; then you might be given a bachelor accommodation; one big room with a bathroom in a multistory building. There's a nice park and playing ground for kids there. Health center facility is good (the doctors; well... that depends). Public transport is not good; but for some it's sufficient. You might need to have a car as soon as you can. Public buses depart every hour or half an hour to Doha (usually quiet congested; but the bus trip from Doha to Mesaieed could be much worse especially at weekends). No taxi. Some drivers might be willing to take you to Doha for small amount of money. There's only....."
Q40_R54_C6 Bad
Thank you very much ... but i think that the company mentioned something about carvans?!! not a multi-story building. Did u happen to see carvans used as residential units? Carvans mainly means : a ready unit used for residential purposes or office. But I can't imagine how to live in carvans especially that it will take big land space to accomodate big numbers. I am single so i will be taking one single room. Please advise.

Luckily I had the email which states this so forwarded this to them. They are now applying for visa and stated that this takes between 3-4weeks. Maybe you need to contact the person who sent your employment offer for hmc directly? Hope this helps you (I'll keep you updated if visa does arrive in 3-4weeks). Good luck

Just visit any one of immigration branch and go to counter and ask for visa extension.

Congratulations on accomplishing a Qrs. 500/- traffic violation... pay the due before your next istamara... and wait for 1 week for it to appear on the website...
Q42_R12_C8 Good
Sound the winning bell! You have just won a parking violation from the police! It'll cost you between 300/-QR and 500/-QR...depends on what kind of parking violation committed. Take care of it immediately and be careful not to get anymore. It'll knock 3 points off of your driver's license and you only have 12 points on there. So now you have 9 points. If you hit 12 points; they'll revoke your license anywhere from 6 months to a year. Sucks; I know.

I got a parking fine for parking the street (opposite the City Center) last Friday! and I've been doing this for few months back. And many still parking there. But I didn't received any parking ticket stick to my car??? So you'll never know when the traffic police will strike and give parking fine huh. Who else got a parking fine out there. Join the party!!!

Hi; I also was in city centre and I noted that police man was trying to get the slip from that; due to some problem he taken snaps and left it. He did for car where they parked in platform left right. Please check it.

Is there anyway we could get a discount with the speeding ticket; if we pay it through the Traffic Police Offices directly?
Q42_R25_C1 Good
Funny. No way.
Q42_R25_C2 Good
LOL. Good question. Perhaps; you meant do they charge a person extra if you they late? On a serious note; you could always prepay your fines to the Traffic Department.

Q42_R25_C3 Bad
I mean like in Oman when my husband has to renew his car registration; they will give him the record of all the fines he has to pay and they will cut the whole total into 50 percent off. Is it the same here also? I ask because; I haven't been speeding a lot and it shows that I have 3 speeding ticket in my record! when I don't really have a fast car to speed up. and I always observe the speed limit! not fair! Just keep dancing; it will do you good!
Q42_R25_C4 Good
Wow Kiarajane; if your car ain't that fast and you still managed to get 3 fines; then I guess you should try at F1. There's something about your driving skills! I just hope those three are speed fines instead of signal jumping. Jumping a red signal fine is upto Qrs. 3000 per violation. Despite my best efforts; in my 10 years of driving in Qatar; I've managed to get just 1 speeding ticket :( I don't think there's a discount concept here in Doha. ----------------------------------------- 300 QL Points!!!

Kiarajane; just press escape button to stop the guy in motion. e46m3 : Thats a whole lotta money.

A guitar it is. That man. Funny.
Q42_R25_C10 Bad
I shall do that! My husband is annoyed about it and he said; how come? he has a fast car and he only have 1 speeding fine. I'll tell you a story; our first parking ticket during Asian game. people are parked across the Khalifa Stadium; so I assume it's alright. I parked there too! My husband saw where my car is park and he parked there too! as we finished watching the game we both found we had a parking ticket and he blames me for that! Just keep dancing; it will do you good!

My information is that the American School of Doha has a majority faculty of qualified and experienced teachers from North America.  The same cannot be said of the other school I mentioned where I know that they have staff there who have no teaching qualification whatsoever and who may not have English as their native language. Most parents looking for an American education for their children would prefer the faculty to at least have English as their native tongue; not to mention the requisite qualifications and experience Ummhamza; calm down; I'm just putting the information that I have out there for the benefit of the original poster.

Salam PM.  Yes; I do find it quite disturbing that there are many schools in Qatar with staff with no teaching qualification.  Most schools are profit making so inevitably (sometimes big) corners are cut and it's always the child who loses by being given a sub-standard education.  I'm also very disappointed that the local Independent Schools have teachers teaching English who cannot even speak English properly.  We are letting ourselves down unecessarily.

I have a boy in 9th grade and school is very important to decide wether we move or not. I understand they are very expensive schools. American International Schools are very expensive every where. I would like to know which of these two school is better with good; certified; qualified teachers; etc; etc. Thank you in advance
Q43_R11_C1 Good
Both schools have good reputations - you have to decide what would be a better fit for your son. ASD might seem expensive compared to QA; but QA is subsidized by Qatar Foundation. Compared to American schools in the region (Saudi; Emirates; etc.); ASD is quite reasonable. For your tuition at ASD you get highly qualified teachers; an excellent facility; ample and varied resources; a friendly student population where new students are usually assimilated quickly; and most typical activities of an American high school; but with an international twist. It also offers extensive AP courses. QA is an IB curriuculum and while I know less about it; I have heard good things from teachers and parents. Both would ultimately be what your son makes of them.

ASD has only has about 40 althanis and about 90 other qataris whereas QA doesnt have many qataris. i prefer ASD because they have better facilities and teachers with outstanding expierence and great degrees.Only about 30% of ASD students are arab with American or Canadian backronds.

If you are planning to go back to America; then ASD is your best option; because; as far as I know; it is the only school that follows a US curriculum. Their website is very informative. ASD is where most American children go to school; including embassy-related children. They do not start until pre-k (four years old); so looking for a good preschool is probably your best option and then enrolling your child in ASD for the following. Space is limited for Pre-K; and so my understanding is that applying on the first day possible is important--this is usually a day in the autumn; but the website can help. In terms of good preschools; there are several; and where you live will make a difference. There are MANY threads on this side with parents discussing the merits of each. I have heard very good things about Appletree and Starfish. Joining Doha Moms is a good resource too; even if just until you settled.

I am not a blogger but I have seen this thread; and I think you should know only go for DESS and Doha College. Not any more but 2 years ago I would have recommended DMBS too; but beware all stay away from it now! Doha Montessori and British School has changed it's name to Doha British School because the staff had nick named it; Dodgy Management Bully Staff; so the management wanted to take their name out! But take this advice for what it is worth from someone who knows; management has been taken over by the third reich!

Q43_R51_C10 PotentiallyUseful
Honestly; One of the worst schools i have ever seen not just in Doha; but world wide. Not a learner place; but rather a place for kids to kill time. It looks organized; but kids learn nothing usefull at that school. The international school of london is one of most expensive schools in Doha and yet the worst by far. Everyone i know attending the international school of London in Doha is about to leave the school. Poor education and a total waste our kids time to send them to this school. Stay away of this school and try other ones. Such as Global; Doha College; DESS. We and our friends had a terrible experience in regards to learning. Some of us managed to send the kids to other school and some are looking for places for their kids. Read more: http://www.qatarliving.com/node/2317901#ixzz1oncaEpuY

The choices for support of special needs are limited here; folks. I've lived here for 15 years -- I should know!

Pike - I totally agree with you!!! Jamon; everybody needs to learn a bit more about those so called teachers who are responsible for our children during school hours. Not just meet them at school. And anyway Jamon - Pike seems to have ALL the data about the school as proved in the long post.

it sucks. If you do wish to bring your kids up in the malayali culture; then this is the school to enroll your future malayali citizens. The teachers talk strange and expect the children to excel in their forte... you know; the 'simbbly sduupeed; gelf male-ya-lee egg-scent' Depends on what you want to bring your kids up as... supermarket staff or elite! Well if you choose quality over cheap 3rd class education; it comes with a price tag; however the results speak for itself. DESS is still one of the best.

I have tried hard finding a non-mallu Indian school in Qatar. DMIS to a certain extent has maintained its immaculate stature even though you hear lot of Mallu accent in its campus now a days. Fees structure is expensive but teachers are very professional. I hear DPS MIS also has good standard. MES no doubt gets good results evey year; but I am scared to subject my children to such cultural shock.

Q45_R25_C4 Good
Visited ISL and have to say that it's a very impressive campus (Doha standard). Don't know much about academic. Stay away from any Newton schools. I visited all 4 of them and could never thought of sending my kids there. It's a waste of money (if you have to pay for yourself). Education? Read more blogs from QL. If you can afford ISL; then visit the new American school located closed to Landmark Mall. The campus is as nice as ISL. Fees are way overpriced. Can't afford to send my 2 kids to these schools. We are leaving Doha because of school issues. Good Luck
Q45_R25_C5 Good
Hi; I can only give you an account of my experience...whether it is a true reflection of the school I don't know. Firstly; it's in a lovely building; but it is only a temporary base. They could give no idea when a move would be made. The school has no sports facilities I was told. Secondly; I saw no children as they wouldn't accede to my request to look around the school. The only people I saw - Admin staff - were; without exception; Lebanese. Therefore; I got the distinct impression that it is a Lebanese School. Thirdly; they took my non-refundable application fees (QR1;500 for 3 children) quite happily; and haven't offered any places - they just request more and more pointless information. I; too; will be leaving Qatar at the earliest opportunity because of these school issues. They all take non-refundable application fees; whilst knowing that they cannot offer places - it's called fraud in the real World isn't it? My advice - choose a country that can actually offer education for yo.....

Not the best; but not the worst - take the places for now and look to move them to a better school when you can
Q45_R25_C9 Good
The ISL website is misleading because they do not place children in groups according to age. The placement is based on their view of your child's ability. Your child could be a star in your home country; but you may find him/her sharing a class here with children a year younger. I think this is the way they weed you out if they don't want your children. So; beware; don't hand over any fees until you get some straight answers; or you have a solid recommendation from someone else - whose children are actually at the school.
Q45_R25_C10 Bad
Thank you for your replies.In my case; they only have place for my youngest son (2;5). I don't tnink I'm going to have any problem regarding his placement!but for my eldest son (4 years old) I will certainly beware of it! Thank you for your advice.

I would like to find the school first and then the house;as I know the trafic in Doha is a nightmare!

Dear Olivka; What you have heard is not true regarding the nationality of children at the school which is in Al-Waab near Sports City that has opened only this week. A friend of mine has her children registered there and she tells me that there are hardly any Arab children there. The majority of kids are those of RasGas;Qatar Gas and Qatar Airways employees who are not Qataris or Arabs. I am also told that all the teachers are British and the building is great. From what she told me; if I had kids I would have taken them there.
Q45_R26_C3 Good
It seems to me that there is some confusion. Yes; there are many Qatari children at the D Ring Road branch of Newton International School and there are plenty of them at the West Bay school; as well as quite a few Arab-speaking children who are not from Qatar. However; I am reliably informed that the new Newton British School in Al-Waab does not admit Qataris; although there may be one or two Arab-speaking children who are not Qataris. Like some other schools in Doha; the Newton International School at West Bay and the school at D Ring are supposed to follow the English National Curriculum. However; Islamic Studies and Arabic are definitely not part of the English National Curriculum; but nevertheless these subjects take up a significant slice of the available teaching time. This means that there is less time available for other subjects; such as Maths; Science and English. Another important point to remember is that the school day for many schools in Doha is significantly shorter than.....
Q45_R26_C4 Bad
My two sons were in the Newton school last year. Kids are from multi-nationalities I didn't like the school for several reasons. One of them that they don't teach enough Arabic or Islamic studies. Some of the other reasons are as following: Kids were seen unsupevised most of the times some Teachers and people in admition office are not polite. Thy yeal to parents and kids all the time. one of the teacher don't explain any thing in the class he only set on his seat with a labtop to watch football. my son didn't have a math teacher for half a year. they don't have swimming pool as they said when we enroll my sons. ....and many other things. My children now in a different school.
Q45_R26_C5 Bad
I've been there and I saw with my own eyes - kids there are almost 97% from Arabic countries. Yes; they have British system but kids on break time speak Arabic... For Muslim parents this school is the best choice - their kids will learn Arabic from their schoolmates very fast and English from the teachers... For the other parents who are not interested in their kids to be fluent in Arabic maybe it's better to find another alternative...For example; schools where kids are from European countries and can learn French; Dutch; or Spanish as second language. The only problem it's hard to get in those schools... The best way to know is not to rely on forum advises but go and see it yourself; isn't it?
Q45_R26_C6 Good
I was at Newton British School with my friend whose kids are studying there yesterday. I am sorry Olivka but you don't know what you are talking about. There are almost zero Arabs in the school and the kids talk in English during their break time because they don't know Arabic; I heard them myself! I am speaking about Newton British School in Al-Waab near Sport City. Sorry Olivka but you are completely wrong and as I have found from the regisrar the children are from the USA; Australia; the UK; Canada; Germany; Japan;New Zealand etc. The school has just opened but have a serious enterance examination. Sorry but 97% of students from Arabic countries does not apply to any school in Qatar that uses English as a medium of education let alone NBS.

"Let's start again. There are now THREE different branches of Newton. Two are called ""Newton International School"" and one is called ""Newton British School"". The two branches of N.I.S. are in West Bay and the other is next to the D Ring Road (aka Al Mamoura). Newton British School is in Al Waab; just round the corner from Villagio. Now the two branches of N.I.S. have a significant number of Qatari children; together with other Arab-speaking children; as well as expat children. The Newton British School does not have any Qatari children (to the best of my knowledge) and only a few Arab-speaking children. The two branches of N.I.S. have Arabic and Islamic Studies on the curriculum; whereas the Newton British School does not. I hope that this clears up any misunderstandings.

I can agree that the Newton British School has a good mixture of nationalities without any one nationality dominating.

Like Dracula said; buy; dont rent...but for that price; you can go to Obeidly (in Sofitel)...but i think they have older cars. Some running alright but i would avoid them.

Just a word of caution. Go for the branded car rentals like Hertz; Europcar. They have flexible renting policy. If you make an accident with your car the local companies will charge you for the period the car is in garage and no replacement. However you are more comfortable with branded companies as they follow international norms.

If you are here on a 2 year contract you might as well as purchase a new car. Should work out cheaper for you @ the end of it all. Monthly installments on a lancer should be somewhere around the Qr. 1000/- mark. Just a thought.
Q46_R13_C8 Good
Going for a new car (purchase) is the best option for you if you are on a 2 yr contract-renewable. (Local car rental companies also provide replacement cars and could sometimes be cheaper than intl. companies. You could rent lancer 1.3L from QR.1600-1700 or Lancer 1.6L from QR.1800-2000 for 2 year fixed term contracts. Shorter term could cost a bit more. If assistance needed; send me a PM)

Flexy rates available here; including 'Pay by Miles' packages especially ideal for the low mileage users.
Q46_R13_C10 Bad
Again; thanks to those who have recently placed some information on the site and the suggestions with regards purchasing. I get an allowance; so I think it is a consideration; but I do like the idea of a rental company maintaining it; rather than me having that extra cost. Certainly food for thought tho; please keep them coming.

No forget Karwa... those people r dumb. Just go to any rent a car and rent it from them. U can get a bus for around 1200 or 1500 a day.  When  I was working at Al Sulaiman Rent a car in 2004; the prices were 800. But i am not really sure if its around 1200 - 1500. Better to check. Even  Al Muftah rent a car gives buses for rent.  It's always the small things that make big differences.

I've contacted a few bus rental places (Thrifty; al-Muftah) and their prices are around QR750.  Is it possible just to hire a private guy who drives a bus around?  Giving him a reasonable per hourly wage; QR400 should be enough.

Better visit the insurance companies and get the rates. it is also important to know the repu of the company in the market and about their customer services.

NO! Why; oh; why would you want to take a pay cut to come here??? This is not a kind place to those who are struggling financially. Let me just say that after skimping on food; you won't be able to go anywhere (no car) and you will have no money with which to do anything. Great life; huh? Mandi

Hello dear; I am not sure what to tell you but each one of us is looking for something different and also in a different situation; the short answer is No unless you are here to join a family member or planing on staying here for few month till something else open up; Qatar is relatively expensive compared to many close by destinations but it could be decent and moderate for those who know how to save; wish u best of luck.

Q47_R26_C9 Bad
maybe you did not intend for it to sound rude; but it definitely was in my opinion. I do not at all wish to start a stay-at-home vs. working people war; but just wanted to show you how your post sounded. No one has a perfect life; all of us work hard! We need to support each other and lift each other up. That means respecting everyone and not trying to downgrade a certain segment of society.

A word of warning people - a young British guy and his British girlfriend were leaving the Ramada on Thursday night; they were holding hands and kissed goodnight. They were promptly arrested and spent the night in jail. Don't know if they're out yet or not. Now I don't know what type of kiss it was - peck on the cheek; lingering; full-on tonsil tugging; whatever - BUT just be careful out there; OK?

Very True BG!. Qatari's are very generous sharing their bread to us expats; and what most of us do? cry over and over again about the discrimination.
Q47_R31_C8 Good
And much like all human beings you get good Qataris and bad Qataris; noble Qataris and ignoble Qataris; righteous Qataris and corrupt Qataris; courteous Qataris and non-courteous Qataris; etc etc. Personally the Qatari ladies who I have befriended; and my husband's khafeel and his family and all my husband's Qatari colleagues are overall good; friendly and generous people; Allahu alam. And I do find many locals; even strangers my family and I have met fleetingly; to be very helpful and giving. Of course there are quite a few not so nice ones as well; but I just put it down to their own personal downsides and erroneous ways; and will not consider them a slight on their nation itself.

Q47_R45_C4 Bad
doesn't that hurt???? Oh sorry Qatarized not catherterised; sorry my mistake ;) xx
Q47_R45_C5 Good
It could very well be true. Qatarization is a very high priority here. But with that said; saying that Qataris should fill secretarial positions and getting them to do so are two different things. A national is going to have to want the job before the job is Qatarized. I'm not sure how this would be handled so I don't see it happening overnight. I'm not sure if this refers to replacing people already in positions or for new positions opening up. One would like to think that expats will keep their job until their contract runs out at least. Also - it could be that a qualified Qatari is given first opportunity at a new position and if it isn't filled then it can be opened up to expats. In any event - it will take time to sort out.
Q47_R45_C6 Good
"I can see it happening overnight indeed. In my organization we have four administrative positions sitting empty that have been reserved for Qataris. No one wants them; we had one woman for a while; but she quit after a month as her husband thought that it was too far for her to drive. What silliness; we can't hire anyone to fill the positions as they are reserved for Qataris; but we can't find any Qataris willing to take the jobs; and nothing is getting done. Why are administrative positions considered to be ""unskilled"" anyway? A good admin assistant is worth their weight in gold."
Q47_R45_C7 Bad
light of the subject but think it is a valid point that gumby made; if there are people willing to do the job; myself included but the positions are empty being reserved for Qatari's it seems so pointless :( please excuse me I am at the moment mesmerised by the above signature!!!! lol
Q47_R45_C8 Bad
Me too....Who is that? Visit www.qatarhappening.com
Q47_R45_C9 Bad
"the ""pecking"" order for jobs has always been Qatari first; second was other arab and third was any other nationality. Admin jobs (particularly HR) have always been seen as an easy Qatarisation option. It's not like an operational job where; if somebody screws up; there's often a big bang or an accident. HR and its systems can slowly deteriorate with no apparent effect......until the system does collapse and by then it's often too late. Enter the expats again to sort things out. One comment. If the jobs have been vacant for so long; do you actually need the jobs?"

true; and yet they have the nerve to charge the same rates. i started out when the exercise areas and classes were mixed but lost my motivation when they were segregated. the treadmills were always cramped during rush hours in the female area and there was even a time when you needed to limit treadmill use to 20 friggin minutes. all the other equipment are limited to one machine for each type while the male area always has at least a pair and not all the equipment there are available in the female area. initial physical assessment is crappy and overpriced and the trainers don't really give you a proper program even when you're just starting unless you sign up for personal training with them. had a row with their manager when i was trying to cancel. they gave some lame excuse about their new system that makes them unable to ante-date my cancellation to the time they weren't able to charge my credit card anymore and i myself stopped coming at the same time. got even lamer excuses about t.....

You can consume liquids in a gym. In the gym; there is a very high probability that fasting muslims won't be working out during the fasting period. Try to be as discreet as possible when you are not inside your house.
Q48_R15_C6 Good
It is advisable that you eat and drink only where you cannot be seen by Muslims. Straight approach: if you are familiar with the neighborhood; you can simply ask them if they feel offended by eating by the pool or not. The same applies to the gym. At my work; most of the Spanish staff asked me if I feel offended by them eating & smoking in front of me; and I told them I don't mind at all. Smoking also is prohibited for Muslims in Ramadan.

Buying supplements in qatar can be frustating because of limited sellers and really high price. GNC is crap as they sell standard stuff and overcharge. Try Top Sports in Al Nasser area very close to Family Food Center; they are selling Optimum Nutrition and Nitrotech stuff; or you can visit some local Gyms they have good stock of supplements as well. Try al Al Freej Sports in Mansoura; then there is one Gym behind old National Library they have good collections of supplements. One online store in qatar selling stuff from SCITEC nutrition; but i think you need to go and collect from the Rayyan Store. http://www.newsport.qa/ Best of luck

Q49_R31
What do you think how much i should tip the stuff in a beauty salon for manicure/pedicure; massage or haircut?? Any idea what is required in Qatar?
Q49_R31_C1 Good
let's say QAR 1000 as a token of appriciation.
Q49_R31_C2 Good
what do u expect by tipping them? i believe they are given a salary for what they work for & each employee here is usually given a brief of their job & most are employed pertaining to their qualifications. in my preview; you are doing something wrong which may even cause the workers to loose their job if the Salon owners get to know + the staff may likely to require the same benefit from every customer they get & this is likely to create attitudes in their minds about regular customers. please dont encourage such behaviors!
Q49_R31_C3 Bad
When I talk about a tip I mean a small amount what is very common in other countries. I just want to know how people handle that in Qatar?
Q49_R31_C4 Good
10% Mandi
Q49_R31_C5 Bad
wooh... 10%? Tip is something that you give because you like what they done to you or what service did they make and there is no minimum or maximum for tip. It's a gift.
Q49_R31_C6 Good
The tip will go to the Salon owner obviously.. Or else you will have to give 10 Riyal in hand for a 100 Riyal Bill; which is even more awkward...Leave in Peace..
Q49_R31_C7 Good
It's confusing sometimes; when your bill for a small tiny service is only 20 or 25 and then you have to leave a tip....ofcourse not less than 10 Riyals. I usually do not exceed 15 Riyals for services worth 100. But since most of the times you'll need more than one emplyee for more than one service;then 10 is fine for each one.
Q49_R31_C8 Bad
understand if you are being generous;its really up with you how much u want to give specially if you are satisfied with their services. :D
Q49_R31_C9 Good
I get my eyebrows threaded cost at 20QAR; I tip the girl QAR5. A mani-pedicure costs me 100-150 (with spa/massage) and I tip the girl 10-20 riyals. Why? Coz to clean my feet and nails would take at least an hour; plus cleaning the ingrown without causing you to bleed; wounded...is a feat. (no pun intended). These women who works in the salon works from 8:30AM to 11:00PM; no overtime pay; salary is about 1000-1500 a month and some of them only have HALF DAY offs. They are provided with accommodation and Free transportation but they buy their own food. The measly tip they get helps to augment what they earn. A little generosity wont hurt; right?
Q49_R31_C10 Good
our costumers usually giving 20-30 qr but its still up to u..if your happy for the service provided u can gave as a token of appreciation...its doesn't matter how much it is..wat matters most; you are satisfied and come again... :)

Q50_R22_C7 Good
I dont think you can deliver a baby under the sponsorship of your father and not your husband. One of my friend had the same problem in Dubai...his wife was not in his sponsorship and they had to go back to their home country to deliver the baby. Almost all the GCC states have the same kind of sponsorship laws...thats y i think it would not be possible in your case as well.
Q50_R22_C8 Good
You can have your child delivered in Doha whatever is your sponsorship status. However; whenever you go to make a file in HMC or any Health Center; they will ask you to submit the folowings: 1) Copy of your marriage certificate. 2) Copy of your Passport. 3) Coppy of your husband's passport. However; you will not be able to get residence visa for your child unless your sponsorship is transfered under your husband's name. It is a must to get the visa for the child under his/her father. At that time you will have to face lots of issues like ... your husband's salary certificate; no objection certificate from your husband's employeer etc... So make sure all your documents are in proper order before you apply for residence visa of your child. Best of luck.

Q50_R28_C7 Bad
it is not a matter of representative delay ; all the papers are submitted and the application is in the system I can see it online it is under process the delay is in getting the approval from the MOI
Q50_R28_C8 Good
From your comments I can see that there might be few issues. 1. Your new company might be over the slab of the nationality of your passport. So the MOI has deferred the approval for a later stage. 2. Your application might be deferred due to some missing papers but MOI has failed to update it on their portal. Kindly ask your PRO to check it with Gharaffa Immigration or else you can have the receipt and make a visit in the morning. 3. Also let me know whether you kept ur National PCC attested by Foreign affairs office or the CEID PCC from Qatar. In any case you have to approach the immigration office; there is surely some error that needs to be rectified. If you feel that your PRO is not upto the mark; then take help from a good proven PRO. Good luck brother. Do let me know the outcome Regards

Q50_R29_C6 Good
Alexam is wrong. Perhaps he doesn't have male children above 18 yrs old. My advise is to get a multi exit permit; which cost you only QAR 500; but saves you a ton of headache. No need for any form to fill; just take your son's passport; your ID; and go to the airport immigration dept; and make sure to clearly ask for multiple-exit permit option to the person processing your request.

Q50_R51
Can anyone tell me what are the necessary requirements or papers needed to get a license for liquor?
Q50_R51_C1 Good
Get a letter from your employer giving you permission; basically a no objection letter. The letter also needs to state your salary as the amount of liquor you may buy depends on that. Once you have the letter; bring it to the QDC; bring your rp; and cash (there is a fee but I can't remember how much - there is an ATM there). They will issue you a card; and you are done!
Q50_R51_C2 Good
what i heard is..salary certificate not below 5k and NOC from the company that they are allowing you to have such license.
Q50_R51_C3 Good
Minumum Salary requirement for a Permit is a minimum Basic Salary of Qr.4000/- If you meet this requirement then : 1. A Salary certificate on your company letterhead stating your Basic Salary; Housing;Marital Status & Job Position held. 2. Qr. 1000/- Cash (Refundable Deposit) 3.

Q50_R51_C10 Good
I just applied for a permit last night with my husband; who is here under my sponsorship. We were issued a joint permit; with a shared limit based on my salary; but we each received our own card. My husband just arrived and is not yet employed. If you are not employed; and if your father were willing to apply with you; perhaps you could get a joint family permit. I have had to write a no objection letter in order for my husband to apply for a driver's license since he is here under my sponsorship; so perhaps your father could do the same for the liquor permit if you are employed and want your own permit. If your father doesn't want you to have a permit; I think you are out of luck. :-) As a side note; my permit was issued with a limit at well under the 10% of monthly salary I have read about. Mine was issued at about 5% of my monthly salary.

Q50_R69_C4 Good
Can you please rephrase your question?? One can enter QATAR with valid RP if he/she enters QATAR within 6 months from the date of departure..if one wishes to stay for more than 6 months out of DOHA; QR 500 to be paid as a penalty..
Q50_R69_C5 Good
Soniya is correct; only question is; if your husband is your sponsor and has left Qatar then his Work Permit may be invalid; and therefore your sponsor can no longer sponsor your RP and your RP is therefore I think Invalid. If your RP was valid through your own work permit; then that should have been cancelled when you left. If you were here under family sponsorship (not husband) then once you married; that sponsorship would no longer be valid (I think) and you RP as a result is also invalid.
Q50_R69_C6 Good

But dont leave your car @ any shop and leave. Go on saturday morning around 7.30 AM; sit and watch what they are doing and what is the fault. if you are leaving your car for repair; they might charge you more and say this parts has to be changed. So better be there until they find the issue and ask them show the fault. Most of the shops in Doha are cheating the customers when you leave the car for repair and coming on the next day.

Q51_R19_C3 Good
i saw a full review of it (its also called a dacia duster in europe) on a popular motoring program and they were very impressed with its robustness and reliability..it has serious off road capability and is practical around town too. The car itself is good but I'm not sure if it would have good resale value here. But if resale isn't an issue; and you like the car; then go for it by all means. you can search for 'dacia duster fifth gear' on youtube if you'd like to see the review yourself. best of luck:-)

Q51_R19_C5 PotentiallyUseful
well i don't have any idea about renault costs; but what i can tell you with full belief and accuracy is that NOTHING comes close to the reliability and low maintenance costs of japanese cars; especially toyota. they just keep going on and on and on. and if you stick to the basic recommended maintenance schedule; toyotas could run forever haha..i saw a toyota camry few days back which had been driven 798000 kms..that is absolutely and unbelievably high mileage..and the car was ten years old..i could not believe how smooth and quiet it was..all the owner did was take good care of the engine and change oil regularly because he drove a lot..if maintenance and cost and reliability is a concern for you; then japanese cars are the way to go. best of luck:-)
Q51_R19_C6 PotentiallyUseful
Peace be upon you; and how do you do?. First of all; when you live in any Arabian Gulf countries; and thinking to buy a car; then it is better to buy a Japanese car as first choice. However; if you are still new in here and just started working and wants to invest your money in a car; then buy a small Japanese Sedan/Saloon car; as it could save you a lot of money more than any other european cars; specailly here in the Arabian Gulf; as there is not much of experienced good workshops to make maintinane and fix your european car in the future. SO either you go to Mitsubishi cars or Toyota; but Nissan is the last choice as I heared that their workshop is very busy and costing more money; so do Renault which could cost you much more than Nissan. Nevertheless; no one is going to push you away from the car that you would love to buy; but as an advice from a person who has been living in Qatar for 35 years and had and experince with many types of cars; then it is better for you to think more .....

Hi Don; From what I have heard; if you don't wish to buy a new one your best bet is to lease. That way even though you are paying a good bit of $ per month; insurance; etc. is taken care of. I am planning on staying 3-4 years; so to buy you will be stuck with getting rid of the thing; sometimes tough to do and red tape out the wazoo. I lived in Saudi for 11 years; had only one car that I bought new and then sold it to a friend (11 years later) who knew how to handle the paperwork himself. I was lucky. I plan on leasing an SUV. Just what I have heard and what I plan on doing when I hit the turf. Regards; RANDR

my friend; on airport road; take a taxi drive to the airport and take flight to Dubai and got to Kinokuniya in Dubai Mall (order them online so you can pick them up when you arrive). Alternatively; order books through amazon and get them delivered through aramex. Alternatively; buy yourself an ebook reader and download the books online. Or; maybe start a bookshop yourself as there is NO decent bookshop in Doha for the time being.

You transfer no risk nor cost when you lease in Qatar. Everything will still be on you. If it is about the initial cost; buy a 2001 Opel Omega for no more than 10;000 QAR and scrap it after 6 months.
Q51_R37_C5 PotentiallyUseful
If you hire/lease for the lowest price; the more risk cost shall be on you; the more you are willing to pay - the lower the risk costs. You cannot get both together at no or low cost. If you buy the car; you carry the total risk; repairs/maintenance etc. rite ?
Q51_R37_C6 Good
Leasing is expensive; but if money is not a serious concern; then I recommend it. Someone else handles all repairs; maintenance; and paperwork. If you have an accident; they will arrive in a few minutes and sort it. I lease; and rate works out that I would pay for the purchase price of the vehicle in about 3.5 years. It's a big luxury; but when I consider the time I would waste on dealing with a car myself; it's worth every penny. But if you have more time than money; definitely buy.
Q51_R37_C7 Good
Buy if you can buy....but presumably being new to Qatar you won't be in a position to buy so renting is the only way forward! I've done long term rents with Hertz; Eurodollar and now National who have been great. International brands aside; you can also use the local companies; though these can seem quite shady and unreliable at times! You're also likely to get an older car which smells of smoke...but you won't pay top whack for it. My advice; go for a recognized brand. When you take in to consideration there's no maintenance or insurance payable; then it's not a terrible deal; plus if you have to leave on short notice (not unusual) then you have one less thing to worry about!
Q51_R37_C8 Good
You can try Lease/Rent to Own. For example a new Honda Accord-2011 under lease-to-own will cost you approx. QR.2450/-p.m. x 48 months. (If you make any down payment; this amount will reduce accordingly) The car will be yours to keep after all the payments are made; you will bear the cost of repairs; periodic maintenance; insurance etc. It's easy to get in a couple of days time. It will work out cheaper this way rather than conventional lease to own where the company does these tasks but high charges inbuilt in monthly pricing. Our company has lease to own products so if interested send me a PM when required.

"Your first recommendation is to not to buy used cars???? garages can stop unwanted noises!!!! hehehehe.

Btw it is not a type of scarf or something you wear around your ears when it is cold. My car has the battery in the boot (not footwear) and ""dicky"" is not a term widely used. If you didn't know this - you'd say that my car does not even have a battery!!!!"

Q51_R47_C10 Good
Lots of things to check in buying used car; better bring a trusted mechanic with you; under carriage noise is easier to resolve than unusual engine noise so becareful; if you want to check combustion efficiency of a car; check the tail pipe; it must have no oil; and in the morning when you start up the engine for the 1st time; if water condenses out of the tailpipe they say this is a good sign as to engine combustion; i'm sure there are lot of other things you should check; so research as well...

I think it's a pretty good deal too. I'm a fresh graduate moving to Doha from the UK next month on a similar salary and benefit package. Ok; it's not an executive salary; but when you do the calculations it's the equivalent of a pretty good salary in the UK. I concluded that the disposable income i'd have from such a salary in Qatar is similar to that which I'd have in the UK with around a £20;000 salary - not bad for a new graduate. Good luck to you and I hope you go for it.

Hi there! Here's another translator who's moving to Qatar next month. I am a King Fahd School of Translation graduate. I guess we are going to work together. I was wondering the same: Is this salary enough for a fresh graduate to start up a new life there in Doha? I got two friends there and they are paid only 4000 QRs accomodation and transportation free. They are the kind of people who go out clubbing and so; and they said we can save up to 2000 QRs minimum. This is due to the fact that the most expensive things in Qatar are company provided. Go ahead man! Hope we meet there in Ramadan. Good luck and wish you the best. Aziz Casawi.
Q52_R4_C8 PotentiallyUseful
i would only consider this offer acceptable because accommodation is included. even so; 5k/mnth is pretty slim. when you say 'transport included' do you know if this is a car for your own use; or you get a shared bus to/from work. if its your own car; then its ok. but if its only transport to work and back; that stinks. overall; its a pretty miserable salary for a UK grad.

Blackberry is nice but i`d agree with Pothole that unless we get to access the full features; its nothing but a regular cell... which aint worth it ! i was olmost on the verge of shipping one; but i guess i`d just be able to make n recieve calls; at the max get some emails thru pop3 .... hmmmm...

The current blackberry apparatus is being sold at the Royal Plaza; The name of the store is Star-link. They have differrent models in display. The pricing are around 2000-2500 depending on the model you wish to buy. Like any phone out there in the market; If you wish to use the phone with full features you need to open an account with Q=TEL; DIAL 111 and ask for blackberry services. Initial charge for account is 150; then is 125 per month additional to your regular cell phone service. Not HALA CARD USERS. What they offer for features is very substantial in dollars to some US carriers for which you paid premium prices. I used; once in a time a blackberry in the US and it was a great gadget to have with full features. Here in Doha they are pretty good with their services. Yes; I bought a Blackberry and is activated with full features. No problems with it so far.. I bought the model that has GPS services; that will be another story in the future. I'm still testing my new gadget. The Red P.....

Hi guys; I'm hoping that somebody can give me some advice. My husband is in talks with a company about a Senior Project Manager role. The sector is construction.

Thanks guys. We're from the UK. Husband has over twenty years experience in the fit out/refurbishment field and has worked on projects for very well-known brands for most of his career. He has the usual construction management qualifications as well as having attended nearly all the health and safety/asbestos/first aid etc. courses the UK construction industry has thrown at him (a lot; as you can imagine!). He's currently negotiating with a contractor who does high-end luxury hotels/retail outlets/offices and who has bases across the GCC. He's also in negotiation with a company in the UAE; which is why we need to know more about Qatari life etc. We have friends in the UAE; but not Qatar sadly. We're not big spenders but we are big savers; and that's why we're looking to make the move.

hmmm 700?? last I had heared it was 850QR last yr but I know most of my friends atleast give them 1000-1200. But I had heared that as per filipino labor laws u are required to give them minimum salary of 1200..is it true?
Q53_R44_C3 Good
by contract still 700QR.. but its up to you.. Phillipino housemaid 700QR; Indonesia and Ephopia- 650QR..this what it was few months back.. No that conflict with the labour dept of Phill was solved easy..so no changes..
Q53_R44_C4 PotentiallyUseful
No I think your info is incorrect; as I know persoanlly that it was 850 by contract few months ago; its 700 for indonesians; i Just am not sure about that 1200QR pay; if its true that thats the basic for them or not.

So; how much it should cost to paint a 3BHK house if all the washable paints are used? In 2 bedrooms the coloring man is going to use the computer mix shade (What's this). So; if you are having any kind of painting experience please share with me; with an estimate of course.

I always wanted to paint my house in India but was never allowed by my parents.I have experience in painting my room though. I used oil paint :) Seriously. Painting a 3 bed room house would cost you close to 2000 QR including the labour charges.

QR2000 for paint is far too much! Go to Jotun on airport road and they will charge you much less!
Q53_R59_C7 Good
I am an expert painter. I painted my whole house by my self & I am a lady! What you do is go to a paint shop. There are many Jotun shops who will mix all your paints by computer. They have many colorcharts there and you choose. To estimate the amount of paint you need is easy. Go onto one of the paintshop websites (even Jotun has it) provide the measurements of your room and presto. Now it could be that your walls are very dry. In that case you do not want to put paint on it like that. Color pain is more expensive than plain white. So you either do a base coat of plain white or you can use a mixture of water and wood glue (white). Brushes; trays rollers you can get them quite cheap at one of the paint shops. Now regarding the paint to use. You use a waterbased paint for the inside. The outside has an other kind of paint but I have used waterbased paint there too. Did it 2 years ago and is still fine. Matter of fact I did some walls with the more expensive outdooor paint and some with t.....

Q54_R7_C1 Good
doha to dubai. first; you can ship one of the cars; i am told it will cost about 2K QAR/AED. you will need to get a transit visa for the drive through saudi; and for this you will need a valid GCC residence visa. aside from this; i would have thought that you just register the car with the ministry of transportation once you are here (but not sure if that involves anything different than what you would need for a car bought here). if your car is too old you won't be able to register it in doha (i think 2006 models are the oldest allowed this year). no idea about the stuff but good question. i wanted to do the same; it would not have occurred to me that this might be a problem.

i just moved in here. if your visa will be cancelled come august; then i think you can no longer drive it i tried actually all the procedures. if you're planning to export it here through either recovery (trucking) or shipping (container) the first thing you'll do is go to Traffic department; the easiest and less crowded is the one near Al Wasl; 10am is a good time to go there. they will get your vehicle for export test and you have to pay for 25 dhs. then if you tell them you'll bring it to trucking company yourself; you'll pay around 80dhs for the export plates (blue plates) and they will get your old plates and also the registration of your vehicle (card); make sure too you cancel your salik; which has also a booth inside the building. here are the reminders: 1.) insist you'll take the car even with the blue plates; some of the guys will tell you to leave your car with them. with the blue plates; you can drive your car for 14 more days from the day you had the local plates canceled......

Cost of living is less because there's generally less entertainment and stuff to spend on. Rent is crazy expensive. Night life is nothing compared to Dubai's; there are a few bars and no proper clubs; every once in a blue moon there's a party held at one of the hotels. As for ur fiance; she can come here but not on ur sponsorship; she can come on a tourist visa and keep renewing it until u get married and then u can get her the RP on ur sponsorship or she would have to have a job her ready before u guys come so that her company would sponsor her. It is illegal for u to live together but alot of people do it; as long as ur discreet and don't bug anyone than noone will notice. I'm not always right; but I'm never wrong :P - Garfield

"Well; will tell you that they have a River Island; Topshop & Wallis (Which r NOT in the other malls) Seems to be very high street. The NEXT store is better and they also have a small home accessory section. The best selling point of that Mall is that it is alot quiter than the others so you can get a better service plus there is no where to ""HANG OUT""except starbucks so that limits those just hanging out to stare at people.

anyone who has something to do anything with administration of these malls put up a website people. some huge malls going around and the only one I know that has one is royal plaza.

I think people will go there again. Villagio is a convenient place for a lot of people.

For all of you shoppers out there. On July 31; a GAP store opened in Villagio. It is at the end of the canal near the ice skating rink.

Don't worry; Qatari's do a good job of wearing fashionable clothes as well as traditional clothes :) I don't really like GAP; but I do like their stretch shirts (which I like to wear under a t-shirt). If their prices are the same as the US; then I'm happy! In the UK; their prices are crazy!!! __________________________ I Love Qatar - http://www.iloveqatar.net
Q55_R51_C6 Good
And another point to note is that sizes which will actually fit Western people often don't fly off the racks as quickly in other countries. I loved going to Gap in Japan; as I could find clothes which actually fit me in the clearance section; without paying an arm and a leg. Normally I don't shop at Gap either; but it became a must-visit whenever I saw one. Can't wait to visit the Villagio again-- they took me to the Middle Eastern restaurant in Villagio for dinner on my second visit day; and then we strolled around for a bit afterwards. The whole Venice motif rocked!

Spoke to the club manager directly; who tells me of course Fitnes First are looking to capitalise on all the good areas in Doha and have been approached by the Villagio and The Pearl; but like all business opening certain things have to be in place to make the deal worthwhile.Whilst Villagio he agreed is a great site but only if the price is right as these clubs normally enter into very long leases.I am sure that being the worlds largest operator in this field they will make the right moves and cater for their customer bases needs in the future. only death renders hope impossible!

Can u be my wasta? It is EASY if you are on husbands rp; just need patience as this is Qatar they move slow in HR; but they get over 100+ applications a day.

Q56_R23_C8 Good
There is a very simple formula for deciding if you should take a job offer in Qatar. If your take home pay will be more in Qatar than your take home pay in your home country - take the job. Obviously there are hundreds; if not thousands; of factors when deciding something like this. Sadly; no one on this site; except you; can figure out if this is a good opportunity. The truth is your standard of living isn’t going to be much different here than your home country; if you live with a dozen people at home you will probably have similar accommodations here. If you have a 8 bedroom mansion back home; you aren’t coming here for a bedspace in the industrial area. Most expats come here for one reason; money. I’m sure there are exceptions; but if I had to pay taxes and all of my expenses – I would have never made the trip. So do your homework and research the cost of living here versus your home country; then make the decision for yourself. ****************************************** Ou.....

Hi there; You have not mentioned from where he is moving to Qatar. i.e what is his nationality. Assuming that he is comming from westren world; this is an accepatble but not a good offer. His basic salary should be in the range of 20;000 - 25;000 Qr. Again what is his profession;that also matters. So; If he is a westerner I would suggest to negotiate a bit more

It should be more than he is making now; where ever he lives. Food; school; cars are all expensive here. It is more expensive to live in Doha than most; if not all of the USA.

If ya wanna come to work for Qatar Airways; you certainly have a right to negotiate your salary... QAR 2;500 like said earlier; will just get you a furnished bedroom room in someone's apartment.

whats your job title? lecturer/reader/assistant professor/professor? a native british friend of mine who holds a post-doc with a good few years of experience in industry was offered 10K basic (which he declined) to me even 20K is a bit low for a lecturer. its a shame that academics are offered such low salaried here.
Q56_R64_C10 Good
should be making more than 20;500 per month. But that salary is certainly enough to live well on and to save quite a bit on (assuming you won't have a lot of other expenses). Benefits? No taxes! free furnished housing (probably doesn't include utilities -- check on this) free LOCAL medical (note that this is ONLY for local govt. clinics and Hamad Hospital; not the better private clinics in town where folks speak English; and it will NOT cover you when you return to your home country of origin in the summer -- be warned! It should also include free schooling for any kids you have (you don't say if you have any) -- and again; tuition here varies widely; so you need to know their cap on the dollar/riyal amount because I am SURE they would never pay to send your kids to the American School or something that cost more than; say; QR 25;000/year. Here's where some extra expenses might figure into the mix... So; not bad; but that salary is rather low for a PhD.

Be careful; it is one where spoiled rich children with bad habits and manners conglomerate. Because it is so overpriced and because of its location it would attract mostly these types.

well my children are not spoilt; dont have bad manners; havent any bad habits you would worry about and we are not rich - neither are their friends of which they have many.

Hello d-esertmum Where are your kids? How can you be not rich and have your kids attend one of these schools? And if the company is paying the fees then your salary must be quite high.

Hi Cindie; You should really look at QIS (Qatar International School). Although it has mainly Qatari students; they do have a small mix of other nationalities too; AND they are following the UK National Curriculum; in English of course. I have friends who work there. It is definitely worth a look. One school to avoid though - GES (Gulf English School). Not a proper international school; just masquerading as one! Again; I have friends who work there. They say there are some amazing students; and some brilliant teachers. But the whole management structure makes life there quite difficult; and even the pupils pick up on how shambolic it can be. Hope this helps! Good luck! :)
Q58_R19_C8 Good
I can reccommend Park House school highly. The junior school is lovely. I agree with the one comment that said if the sibling is in; it helps a lot. Only problem with Park House versus DESS is the travelling right across town. QIS is worth a look. The new principal there is a British woman and is highly respected in Doha.Great things are happening there- also it's much closer to DESS for travelling purposes.

That comment (I read the article) must have been taken out of context by the journalist because it makes no sense as a follow-on quote. She can't surely mean 'afford' monetarily; but it is hard to decipher what else she could mean. Maybe they can't 'afford' to finance in the sense that it undermines and sends a message that the independent schools are not up to standard? Even that is quite a weak attempt to understand her. Puzzling.

Dear everyone in this forum; I am an India and ny kids are currently studying in an Indian school in Doha. I want some information on DESS (Doha English Speaking school). I want to put both my child (aged 7 and 8) in DESS. I heard the school is very good. can you please suggest how should I prepare them for this? Is there any interview process? Any reference is accepted? Please help..
Q58_R46_C1 Good
Sorry DESS is a community School sponsored by the British Embassy and give Priority to British Passport Holders. If you don't hold a British passport then don't waste you time as they will not accept your application. There are a lot of British Passport Holders on the waiting list. You can try some other Internationals school that teach the English Curriculum like the British School (DMBS) Doha Collge; Parkhouse and Sherbourne etc.

Check the their website all the information is there. Knowing from what I know you have no chance to get into DESS. Sorry but that is the policy of the school.

Thanks for your reply!! I will submitt the application and let's see. But wanted to know about Sherborne. Don't they prefer British passport holders? I heard the fees is also very high in Sherborne.

QDCLover...you are wrong there. Most Indians in here attack only when someone talks no-sense. Somethings we know and would like to keep silent about unless it starts spilling over...:)
Q58_R46_C9 Good
To the OP: DESS preferences British passport holders as it is sponsored by the British embassy and is community school for British children. Limelemon--Check the website; but I recall the first day of accepted applications for the preschool (3 years) being at the start of January. Make sure you submit your application on the very very very first day applications are accepted. Otherwise your chances; even with a British passport; are incredibly slim. Most preschooler spots are taken up by siblings of children already in the school; so that only leaves a handful of spots for new families. The next step is an interview/assessment; when the children and their parents are taken in groups to the preschool classrooms. Basically they play and chat with the teachers for about 30 minutes. Good luck.

I teach at Gulf English school and is has a large range of excellent teachers from UK; Australia and New Zealand. It follows the british curriculum; and there is a choice of IB or A level after year 11 IGCSE examinations. The school is seperated into three sections; infant; primary and secondary. Secondary is gender seperated. There are some amazing people at Gulf English school and the students are warm with a good sence of humour; It is mainly arab students (about 90 percent)and students are taught islamic and islamic studies. There are specialist teachers for french; music; ICT; PE from primary to secondary. Like any school we have our issues but that is human nature. Chuck me an email if you are further interested and I can give you an email address of someone at school to contact. Good luck and welcome to doha

Best to talk to the schools direct via their web sites. Keep your kids with you as long as you can. There is nothing wrong with the schools in Doha. Dess and Doha college are not the only schools; there are many more.
Q58_R56_C2 PotentiallyUseful
DESS is a primary school only. Doha College is good; but not at the calibre of a good UK public school. If you want to follow a British curriculum; I would not seriously consider anywhere else here (they are the only two British embassy-backed schools). The American School is also very good; but a different curriculum and teaching style entirely. If you and your child are willing to endure the separation; then boarding school may be the best option if the decision is being based primarily on academics.

Q58_R57_C4 Good
A number of my tuition students are from Parkhouse. There seems to be little support for those who lag behind in a particular subject. Also the number of UK qualified teachers with QTS (Qualified Teacher Status) is limited. You may wish to ask how many of the teachers actually have QTS compared to those that don't. Many of the teachers are not from the UK and do so not have a background of teaching a British Curriculum. Finally; Parkhouse only follows part of the National Curriculum of England and Wales. The rest of the curriculum is based around what is referred to as the International Curriculum; which is created by a private company in the UK and is not endorsed by the government. This topic has been discussed a number of times previously so you may wish to do a search to get a better idea of the school. You may also wish to try other UK curriculum schools such as Doha College; DESS; Sherborne and the International School of London. Good luck.
Q58_R57_C5 Good
Joe90 Not sure how qualified you are to comment on the status of the teachers at Park House school. ALL their teacher comply with SEC conditions on qualifications of their teachers; otherwise they would not be able to operate! I can confirm the vast majority of teachers at the school are British; 2nd is South African (excellent standard of educated teachers) and other nationalities. The school is as british as it gets in a non-british country. The standards are extremely high. There is very positive school/parent contact and all pupils are expected to work hard; are well disciplined; and result focused. I am british and my children attend Park House. I would have no problem with them returning to the UK (not likely with the current working conditions in the UK!) and slipping into very good schools and coping with the change. If you are typical middle class parents who discipline your children and make sure they stay on top of their studies you will reap the benefit of this school which.....

As a user of the Qatari and British education systems for my children let me tell you that if you have a good teacher; your child and you are lucky! Usually here about 1 in 5 teachers have that power to inspire YOUR child! Be glad when you get one; no matter what school they are paid by! Education is about inspiring children to progress; not about checking off what they have studied!
Q58_R57_C7 Good
Craftyqueen; let me tell you that all the children who are not as good in reading as the rest of their colleagues are taken away from their normal classes; given to a volunteer parent (who is given a bunch of flashcards with no further instructions) who is supposed to help them develop reading skills. Not only is that wrong; but on top of it they miss what is happening in their class. And don't try and tell me it's not true - I was a volunteer parent last schoolyear for Year 1. Is this the way to save on spending more time with the children who need more reading practice? Why not do like the French School - extra hours of tuition after school? Last swimming competition the kids were so excited to show what they could do - instead the swimming teacher used her own son to get a better place for Park House. The amount of dissapointed faces of children was heartbreaking! Waiting hours for nothing? Things are far less positive then what you make them seem!
Q58_R57_C8 Good
Alumnar I am surprised you are willing to say negative comments about the school your children attend on QL. Maybe you should change schools for your kids and give those parents who would remove their right arm to put their kids into Park House their place. In the UK all primary schools ask parents to come into the lower primary classes to hear the children read. I can't understand what could be better than one-to-one reading. If you want to suggest a reading group after school which parents fund I am sure the school would be interested in your suggestion. In the Uk books were changed once a week - here in Park House its three times a week; their books are set based on their individual ability into small groups if possible. The teacher hears the pupil read at least once a week. Parents are asked to participate in their child's learning by listening to their child read at home. Schooling is not a vacuum - a child can learn at anytime anywhere. As for fairness - the World is not fair and.....
Q58_R57_C9 Bad
"Some of the comments that have been made on this thread are more than a little misleading. For example; are we comparing Parkhouse (or any other school in Doha) with fee-paying; independent schools in the UK or are we trying to compare them with state schools in Britain? As Parkhouse is a fee-paying school; I would have thought that the former would be a fairer point of comparison. One person has written that the standards at Parkhouse are ""extremely high"". Well; if there is an acute shortage of school places; then it stands to reason that some of the more popular schools can be very selective about who they allow in through the gates. I have not heard much about Parkhouse's Special Educational Needs policies and I suspect that they would not want to admit SEN children because that might affect their ""extremely high standards"". That also might explain Parkhouse's preference for nice; white English children. Craftyqueen has mentioned the SEC; the Supreme Council of Education. This is a ....."

Q58_R64_C1 Good
Doha College hands down. It's more established; non-profit; better resourced; and has the sponsorship of the British Embassy for the secondary school. If your children are in primary school; Doha College is a good option; but by general consensus DESS is the best (even more established; is solely for primary; and has the sponsorship of the British Embassy). Doha British is acceptable; but; ultimately like so many other schools; it is less well established and is a business; which means that profitability for the owners is important; unlike DC and DESS; who have all the tuition and fees going back into the school.

brightlight is a troll who gets banned once a week and then reincarnates himself. He's posting on all sorts of threads in attempt to stir and get attention.

Doha British is typically an overflow for these two schools; but the waiting list is still substantial. Find out the application dates for all three; and put your name in on the first day for the best chance.

Q58_R64_C8 Bad

Hello everyone; I have got an offer for 6000QR salary/month in a company in qatar for Graduate Engineer position. Is this salary sufficient?

Is this a decent salary for a bachelor in engineering company

Hello Brother; First of all your salary totally depends on your engineering discipline and working experience( are your fresh?). Second thing is keep in mind increments ratio is slightly poor.

Traditional 5th Anniversaries are wood; this can mean lots. From a weekend in a log cabin (porta cabin ha ha); to a romantic walk in local woodlands (do we have any in Doha?). Modern 5th wedding anniversary gifts are celebrated with silverware. Consider getting a silver ring or a locket that has been engraved. There are a number of trinket items as well which can be customized to have your names and the date placed on it. Book a small dhow and spend the evening with her in the middle of the sea; with some good food!

Hi I dont think its possible to rent without a passport/credit card. Atleast they would ask you for a signed cheque. Even if their car is full insured; in case of accident they would always demand a fixed sum; so beware and think twice before you rent.

Truth real estate should be called Lies real estate. I've started dealing with them and they seem quite bad. Before I moved in; they promised the rent included cleaning; but I've found it doesn't.

Q60_R33_C1 Good
It is illegal.
Q60_R33_C2 Good
hummm; seems I was right after all!!! ;p very illegal now!!! Get it; and keep it. It is your's and you can not leave the country without an exit permit anyway for your sponsor; so the company does not need/ and can not hold your passport even if they say it is company policy; it is country policy that they can not hold it;you might need it for hotel bookings; car renting etc. do not hand it back to them; say you still need it as it is your passport. The problem is; people do not know their rights here; and get scared from their employer. If in doubt go to Jarir bookstore; or google the labor dept website. You can buy the labor law book here in Qatar and read it. If they insist on you giving it back to them; make up any reason you still need it; after a while they should forget about it; it is your passport!! don't give it back go report them to the dept. of labour; if they keep insisting; the labour dept will have heavy fines for each passport the company is holding!!!

Well; our company keep our passports with them at HR in a fire proof safe. And I have no problem with that as I cannot leave the country without an exit permit from them. The HR also does my RP every year. And company letter to request Visa for foreign countries.
Q60_R33_C4 Good
"It is not ""yours"" it is the property of the government that issued it to you. No one (no employer or other government) has the right to retain it legally. As for the exit permit argument. Great; if there is someone available to issue the exit permit whether it be a personal emergency or something more sinister. Say for example there was some sort of natural disaster or other crisis and an exit permit could not be issued - how will you prove to your embassy or anyone else who you are and what your nationality is? I'm glad you have confidence in your employer under those circumstances; I don't have the same in mine."
Q60_R33_C5 PotentiallyUseful
They hold it for safety purpose; and they keep in a fire proof safes in thier offices.
Q60_R33_C6 PotentiallyUseful
They don't hold it for safety purposes. It's illegal if that is the honest intent. If the person to whom the passport is issued requests the passport and it is freely given then maybe. But again; what happens if the person(s) with access to the safe are not available? I repeat a passport is the property of the government that issued it to you. No one (no employer or other government) has the right to retain it legally. You may freely give it to them for safekeeping but you have every right to ask for its return on demand. If the company refuses to do so; report them to the Labour Dept and the MoI.
Q60_R33_C7 Good
"Exactly; it's property of ""your"" government; not of your employer. When the HR needs to renew RP's; they must send emails to the department to have the employee's bring their passports & ID's for renewal for the one's that are going to be expiring; after that employee's can get their passports & ID's back. That is the only time they HR has them; few days to process. AND; when you need a visa for whatever country you will request; then HR will prepare it for you. They alreayd have your information saved in their system. they dont need your passport. You can report the company & their A... will be fined.. What if there is a fire a your company? that safe will stand maybe a few hours; not forever. Better be responsible for your own passport. Trust me. My hubby works in a huge company as a HR Admin. who processes these daily; so he knows the rules."

Only thing! Please take it as an advice; never join the committee at the compound as they only want you to demand more to the employer which is a bad habit and ungreatful attitude. never get involve in any of this committee as the employer don't like them. stay away from these people to keep you safe and don't get involve with any of their activities. live normal and peacefully.

Q60_R41_C8 Good
JJH gave a pretty good account of the living area. Al Zahoor-2 is near 2 large shopping centres and many of the larger international schools (American School or Doha College). The only thing I would say is the villa/apartments are dealt out by degrees and departments. Masters get apartments/PhD’s get villas. Of course there are some exceptions but I'm married with a child as are 4 of my neighbors and we all live in an apartment. I would say if you are working for Foundation and have a Masters you can expect an apartment; which are pretty nice and big. Once you get them cleaned and your own personal touches on them they are very livable. There is a swimming pool in the complex and a fitness room. The fitness room is useable but many people join outside gyms like Aspire (10 minutes away). As for not joining a committee; I would disagree with JJH about the reason. Many people have tried to make the place look nicer and stay cleaner (more greenery; outdoor lighting; cleaning; etc...)beca.....

"You say ""As for not joining a committee; I would disagree with JJH about the reason. Many people have tried to make the place look nicer and stay cleaner (more greenery; outdoor lighting; cleaning; etc...)because it needs it. This in itself is very frustrating. It was made very clear that the complex is what it is and changes or more investment by the owner will not happen. For this reason joining this committee can be very embittering and this could blanket your whole experience with the place. Plus; your students and portfolio will bring you enough blood rising. This may be a better reason to avoid these committees. But; if you are a champion for a cause; you can get in the mix. Fighting city hall or join the new Al-Zahoor Sheriff flyer ticketing group.

Hello All; We are moving to Qatar in August. Need advice on sending 2 separate household goods shipments. Any comments on that? What are the documents required to send a shipment; what is required to receive a shipment. Any information on household shipments and regulations would be appreciated. Thanks; Fitri
Q60_R42_C1 Bad
Follow up the to previous ... any idea the transit time for a container from Houston to Doha? How about the advisability of storing shipments in Doha - security an issue? Thanks.
Q60_R42_C2 Good
Hey fitri; We moved here Oct 2004 from Dallas and it took roughly 60 days for our furniture and household goods to arrive. I'm not sure about your second question. As far as I know the shipment made its way to us shortly after it arrived and had cleared customs; so we never stored it. I suppose it would have been nice to send it 2 months in advance of our arrival though.
Q60_R42_C3 Bad
thanks for the info. We will be sending a shipment from China and then later another from Houston. Any idea what documents are required for shipping to and receiving in Doha?
Q60_R42_C4 Good
I believe that the shipping company in the states coordinated with one of the local moving companies and handled most of the paperwork. When our shipment arrived we simply had to find the moving company here and give them a map on where to deliver the goods. There may have been other steps handled by my wife or her company; but it seemed fairly straightforward. Your employer and/or moving company should give adequate instructions. Be aware that they may quarantine and return later anything that they think needs to be reviewed for content; like DVD's; VHS tapes; books; CDs etc. It seems our labeling of boxes helped them in this effort and so some of our DVDs that were in the labeled boxes arrived after quarantine while others that were just haphazardly packed were delivered on the first shipment. http://www.xanga.com/BBetz

Q60_R42_C8 Good
Hi Fitri. i am from India and have come in to Doha 8 days back. The delay in the process is only at the level of the directore I'm told. Apparently once the goods arrive in Doha; the local agent contacts customs and sets a date with them to inspect the goods. This takes up to a week. after customs goes through ALL items; they give their estimate and clearance. There is a tax of 5% on the goods being brought in levied. However household goods are exempted from the tax and the agent applied to the directorate for exeption. This is where takes time and I'm told can take upto 20 / 25 days to gte the clearance. Thus the option seems to be to either pay 5% of the valuation they have done or wait.

Hi; thanks for you reply. Our children are 4 and 2. Do you know if there are long waiting lists for Doha college and qatar Acadamy?
Q61_R13_C3 Good
QIS is a good school and has excellent results. The pastoral side is too very good; with caring staff. Qatar Academy maybe the school where money is no object but the academic standards are not as impressive; especially in Primary. Doha College is a good school but fees are high; Primary section ws a school that merged with the existing Doha College - secondary school. DESS is also a British school here - mainly British kids. Noticed you are from the Netherlands; there is a Shell School in Doha that has the Dutch curriculum incorporated into it. Hope that this all helps; warning there is a huge demand for schools in Doha as the expat population is increasing more quickly than new schools can be set up - so get your children down an a waiting list ASAP.
Q61_R13_C4 Good
if they are primary age; and their english is ok; then i would highly suggest DESS; it hs a lovely campus; much larger classrooms than DIS etc; and also they have much better facilitis than DIS (Doha college primarr)I can speak from experience; i mean thats where i went to primary all those years ago; my sister(whos 13years oldere than me) went to that school and i still think its one of the best schools in qatar for that age group; check their website out www.dess.org

Q61_R13_C6 Good
We relocated our teenagers in August and finally settled for QIS and are very pleased because the school has been extremely helpful and supportive in accepting two non-native speaking kids into year 10 and 12. We can recommend the school to 100%. Our kids came from the liberal Swedish school system but have settled very well. We have visited ALL English-speaking schools in Doha; and the only problem is that they are all full. Waitlisting and constant telephone calls to find out if something is happening is my advice. We spent 6 months before coming to Qatar to find a school; including 2 trips to sit entrance tests. Nerve-wracking - a week before school start we knew they had a place....

It's depend on the job grade; usually they offered cheap package as compare with other industries or companies in Qatar.

Keep all the things in mind and than accept the offer bcz accommodation is the biggest problem in Qatar. But there is no harm to attend the interview; it will be a short trip for you. They will call you for interview in Doha; will take care of your food + hotel + air tickets etc. Enjoy your trip and Best of luck!!

Technical Staff (Engineer & Mech only (support staff not included)) basic salary has recently been revised and additionally; accommodation allowance is under review and expected to be revised by the end of month. Package offered to you would be based on EN02 grade which is among the best in middleast; anybody who says otherwise is not fully aware of ENG package (Support staff package is crappy). Slight variation would be based on your approvals; more you have more you earn. You will make good money on side because of overtime. Beast666

Milou - Try any of the pharmacies in Doha for Levitra. It's the local/regional equivalent for viagra (sildenafil citrate). You can obtain it over the counter (without a prescription). The ladies at the city center pharmacy (level 1) are pretty helpful.

Q62_R37
Any advice on where to buy maternity clothes? So far; the few malls I've looked has either a terrible selection (i.e. a selection of 3 different items) or the prices are out of control. I'm to the point of buying online and paying to ship. Any ideas? (Please; serious comments only; I'm in no mood for sarcastic;silly; male humor this morning...)
Q62_R37_C1 Good
hi Minoush; I think you probably tried these shops already; ie; mothercare;marks and spencer; BHS; Next. Yup selection is awful; and prices are ouch. Have you tried H&M? They did have many trousers; price range was 160-250Qar. The other thing to do would be to invest in good pair of basic colour trousers and get your tops stitched.

Haven't tried Mothercare at CC. I hate going there but I may have to... M&S does not have a Maternity section. I don't get this... every local has at least 5 kids; plus every expat seems to be pregnant. Where do they all shop for clothes?
Q62_R37_C3 Good
I tried H&M and their selection was ok. The only problem were the pants had this new fangled design where the waist is supposed to sit below your waist and it felt like my pants were about to fall down. Just too hip and cool for me. I'm old and I need mom jeans! :-) I will try BHS. I'm used to Target and discount stores. The idea of paying $80-$100 for a pair of pants that I will wear for 6 months is impossible. Checked online; shipping from Motherhood Maternity from the States is $70 for a ton of clothes. I think I will just do that.... Thanks ladies!

Q62_R37_C4 Good
try babyshop and Max in City Center. thay have good collection
Q62_R37_C5 Good
hi Minoush; you will have to go to Mothercare at CC; because apparently all maternity wear from other MC shops are to shift to MC of CC; if not already there. You need to visit the MC inside Debenhams. The locals wear the abbaya; so a loose gown inside ( the jalabiyas; more like the house maxis) is not visible to anybody. Among Asian clothes there are many loose tops in style right now; with lycra tights; so again no problems there. Getting T's is not an issue; as long as you are okay with it hugging you tight all day. The trouser style; is the low bump style right now; and it doesnt really fall off.H&M had the high waist trousers. not sure about baby shop for Maternity clothes; else you may have to try the large clothes section; like Evans; if you are looking for comfy tops. Check Giordano as well; they dont have maternity; but they usually have these loose comfy linen trousers that you can tie under the bump.

Based on all our comments; a trip to City centre is on the cards :-). You should find what you are looking for in atleast one shop there. You can also check Chico.

I went for the first time to Ezdan today and what a complete and utter piece of trash it is. The finishings in Tower 3 were atrocious. How could the builder let this happen? The building is relatively new and already broken tiles; filthy cielings and walls. The wall tiles are still filthy from the worthless masoners who installed them. Typical old Doha masonry. Paint around the light switches; paint on the trim; careless finishing throughout. PLASTIC MOLD DOORS?!?! How cheap can they be?? Seriously I would not pay 2000 QR a month for any these crap dwellings. Filthy windows; CHEAP CHEAPO CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP a thousand times over. All this and I can believe people actually live in this skunkhole. TRASH TOP TO BOTTOM. I have seen better in the older buildings near Musheirib
Q63_R13_C4 Bad
Don't beat about the bush.. Tell us what you really think :o)
Q63_R13_C5 Good
that's true. Finishing sucks; as elsewhere in Qatar. Furniture is not brand new; but at least comfortable and clean. Lighting is dull in the appartments... Kitchen is too tiny...Windows are small and dirty; but now they started to clean them. To cover all these negative points they provide the best gym and swimming pool in Doha; free of charge for tenants. Free cabel and Internet; free shuttle bus from your Tower to City Center; so you don't have to spend hours trying to find parking there. Housekeeping 2 times per week; full maintenance service. Small cafe in the Towers - you can enjoy a fresh coffee in the mornings; the sea food restaurant...Small play area for kids with slides and swings. All this is very helpful for the family with kids - especially housekeeping:)! Pesonnel is friendly and professional.

My friend lives there; it's very cheaply built and you have a hard time getting wireless in the apartments. He doesn't recommend it at all.
Q63_R13_C7 Good
it depends on what your requirements are... i've lived there for a month now and can say it is rather cheap overall (but it's also less expensive than others in the area to be honest) and already had few plumbing problems in my flat.. on the other hand it is very convenient if you work on this side of town as it will save you a lot of traffic headaches... plus i agree with olivka: gym and swimming pool are very good **Sic dixit Zarathustra**

I've been at Ezdan since mid August. Im in Tower 4 however... I've heard some crap about 1 and 2 but 4 is cool. The only pain I've had is that they insist on doing one of the 2 cleanings per week on a friday morning. I mean.. really.... most people are trying to sleep.... I would think it would make sense to do it during the week. I have a 1 bedroom (livingroom; kitchen; bedroom and 2 bath) on a 2 month contract. Honestly; I think its overpriced (and Im only on the 6th floor). But other than that... its pretty decent.

No surf in Qatar =( UAE and Oman have some decent waves. There are a few reefs here that seem to have the potential to throw a decent wave but just not enought movement in the water.

It was horrible; what else should I say; half of the teachers aren't british; well the english language wasn't even their first language; it would be the second or third. Alot of spoiled students and no control! My information are old; I left EMS 2003 and if you want to make sure if the school changed or not; make sure that Kiryakos or whatever her name was is not workin there anymore; all she cared about was her self byt using the real owners of the school.

I would have to say Jet was the best with Leather Seats; nice leg space; good service et all...(Jet's service is legendary in India) In QA & GA both; my knees were continously touching the front seat & was very uncomfortable. It felt almost as if I was travelling in a Bus...lol Sevice wise I guess all were as good (QA with Filipino staff were good too); But the comfort of the Seat and the Leg space would be the most prized by me.

As an ex-ACCA marker for the audit paper; I would have never passed you with this level of English. Please take this as a positive criticism. To answer your query; I would say ACCA is not so popular here in Qatar as it is in Bahrain and UAE. And salary wise; like H M H said; it would all depend upon who you will be working for.

jawad tahir; those Indians I mentioned are Chartered Accountants (India). Their Association is regulated by the ICAEW which is of similar standing as ACCA. Also; a few I met were ACCA as well. Sadly; nationality is the downfall of some professionals which I find unfair. Your subsequent replies are well written. The English is good. Keep it up. Don't take it too personal. You see; being a Fellow; I take so much pride of being associated with the fast growing Professional Body and I try very hard to avoid bringing disrepute to the Association. It's one of the code of ethics and bye-laws. So sorry I seemed to have offended you. But please read your post and see for yourself how many mistakes it contained. I am not sure if I want to elaborate on that. Keep well and good luck with the ACCA. It is; IMHO; the best Accountancy qualification in the world.

Q65_R62
While police department allows for short course (while having an experience)while some of driving schools try to make things difficult through pre-test; just for their profit or they have not such qualified instructor who can train with propose time.(because all time instructor also force student to go for full course).
Q65_R62_C1 PotentiallyUseful
Good point......New in town;me and my friend are facing same problem......why they complicate things .I heard karwa is very clear about it and tell clearly everything at the time of admission.
Q65_R62_C2 Good
Actually as for my case; since I have my valid license in my home; I am entitled for a half course or direct test. Full course may be required if you don't have existing license or expired. Otherwise; no driving school will require a full course. There are a lot of driving schools out there; Al rayya driving school; karwa; etc.
Q65_R62_C3 Good
I also have driving licence(from home country) and go for short course but after having pre-test (which is not mandatory)they forced for full course and according to other student it is their practice especially for short course student and important is they never tells students about such so called pre-test at the time of admission after having few classes they inform you about pre-test which is unfair........ while with karawa after completed the classes you can go directly for test with police department(which is quite normal).

Rayan driving school is good ; I had a very good experience with them and I have already forwarded few of my team mates for driving classes there .
Q65_R62_C5 Bad
Notice rodqie76; he mention that they forcibly or tactfully impose long/full course through so called pre test;and they refuse students to go for the test with traffic department; and after giving admission fee no one think to go any other institute. Why don't they allow direct test with traffic dept;Let them decide who can drive or not.don't pressurize for long course!! Make each and every thing clear at the time of admission. Anyone can help or suggest how to stop out from such situation????
Q65_R62_C6 Good
So we are at the same point that they are good for long course or full course but not having qualified instructor who can teach in certain time and therefore they enforce through pre-test to go for full course. In case any student wish to go for test then they refuse even they didn't allow to submit the exam fee of that student while other institute doesn't have such they follow the proper rule by traffic department;while they are having their own sub-rule. Point is if traffic department allows for short course or direct test why they take pre-test and enforce for full course. It is good only for those who are not sure either they can drive properly or not!!!not for all......... any way Congratulations you got your licence after having full course.
Q65_R62_C7 Good
Good point razingbull.....but the question comes in mind about the credibility and quality of rest of the institute!!!!and in that case the leverage given by traffic department is just waste because they allow such students to go directly to the TEST..........not enforced pre-test.
Q65_R62_C8 Good
"You are lucky Razingbull......if these are quality measures why they are hiding at the time of admission if someone insist to pay exam fee at the same time they said you will pay three days before exams.....why they are showing such double standards;if they are quality conscious then must inform to students ""if you pass pre-test then institute allows you to go for test if you agree then take admission"" other wise they are over ruling the permission given by government/traffic department which allows for direct test or short course."

Q65_R68_C6 Good
First you should ask your wife's opinion in that matter. You should both sit together and discuss how important this job to her and to your budget. If there are other offers; you will need to consider them as well. Also; many companies have regulations banning immediate relatives to work in the same office and for the same company sometimes; unless in different branches or separate departments. Please consider these issues: - Can you both guarantee objectivity and separation between work and home? - Can you both handle closeness all day and night long? - Are you both highly competitive which might cause jealousy between the both of you and might affect your relation?

If you have a valid driving license from your country of origin; you can drive a rental car for a period of seven days. However; if you have an INTERNATIONAL DRIVING LICENSE; THERE IS NO TIME LIMIT. Before the seven-day period is up; you will need to get a temporary driving license that is valid for the period of your visa. All nationalities may exchange their country of origin's license for a temporary Qatar license; however you may not do so if you have already started the residence visa process. If this has been started; you will have to wait for the visa before applying for a permanent license. To obtain the temporary license; you will need to apply in person at the Madinat Khalifa Traffic Department; where you will be required to complete an application form. This will have to be completed in Arabic (there are a number of typing shops within the confines of the traffic department who will assist; for a small fee).

first of all you have to get your residence permit; afterwhich you can apply for a qatar driving license. if you already have a driving license from your country; take note that most of the western countries they will just convert it. no need for you to take up the test or go to a driving school. if your license is from asia; it depends; but most of the asian license you have to undergo a driving test (signal; L and pocket parking; road test) or the traffice department will suggest on your application form to go to a driving school for two weeks. hope this helps

Among GCC states; it is understood that; anyone with a GCC driver's license can temporarily drive in any other GCC states but if the individual will have permanent residence then he has to secure a local DL. securing the local DL is the culprit in a lot of confusions. I have a UAE (abu dhabi) DL gotten on Dec. 1993 and expiring this Dec 2008. when i moved here in qatar on Dec 2004; i used my uae driver's license when i was still on a business visa. After i got Qatar RP;I applied for a Qatar DL at the Traffic Department. I submitted my original UAE DL for inspection and then they required me to have an eye test only. After passing the eye test; i was issued a Qatar DL In some GCC states; I hear this is not the case; for example; here in Qatar I hear that they do not recognize Saudi DL? Some GCC states requires DL applicants (even with applicant with GCC DL from another state) to undergo driving schooling;driving test to secure the local DL.

7 days since your arrival you can drive using your home country's license. After 7 days; but only up to obtaining your Residency Permit; you can drive using a Qatari temporary license or an International driving license. After getting your RP; you will need to convert it to Qatari permanent driving license either by direct conversion (from some countries) or sitting through the test. My understanding is that US driver's license holder use to be able to directly convert theirs into the Qatari temporary and then permanent DL; but not anymore.

dude; I came here on a visit Visa. Screw the car rentals; you think they know anything? I went to Traffic department and asked. #1 - Not all international licenses are valid.

After 2 weeks if you get into an accident; it is your fault no matter what. Car rentals don't tell you these things because you are buying their insurance anyways! #3 - International License means nothing without your original license from back home. When you want to make the Qatar License; you NEED your original license from back home and it has to be recognized so that you don't go through the driving tests in here.

I took a 2 week leave which coincided with the 3 days Eid-el-Fitr holiday in the middle. The company deducted my salary for these 3 days saying that the holiday fell within my leave so i was not not entitled to it as 'paid holiday'. Is it true that the Qatar Labour Law for this section has been interpreted as such?
Q67_R44_C1 Good
yes its correct...it is a public holiday so will not be entitled to receive any salary for these 3 days

Q67_R44_C5 Good
your company is wrong. They should not include the EID with annual leave or unpaid holidays. EID is public holidays and fully paid unless you work on EID and get over time for it. check with labor department. but i'm certain on this.

what crap; EID is a fully paid public holiday....as Legend said above!!
Q67_R44_C7 Good
If the three holidays were before the starting of your leave then you are entitled to get the salary. If those three holidays were at the end of your holidays then you are not entitled. In the second case you should have joined at least the day before the Eid holidays. In your case you are not entitled as the Eid holidays were in the middle of your leave.

Article (78) The worker shall be entitled to annually; leave with full wage as follows: 1. Three working days for Eid EI-Fitr 2. Three working days for Eid Al-Adha 3.

Is it difficult to get a taxi from the Delhi airport to Agra? How about getting around in Agra; is it hard? How about getting back from there to Delhi? What I'm trying to ascertain is whether it's better to get a travel agency to organize it for me or if it's better that I book the hotels myself and just catch a taxi. Thanks!
Q68_R24_C1 Good
Will you staying in Delhi or Agra? If you are staying in Delhi... you can ask the Hotel to arrange day trip for you to visit Agra. Hotel people can assist you in getting Taxis..don’t hire a taxi by yourself..There are lots of crimes happening with foreigners. To be on safer side always go for prepaid taxi arranged by your Hotel. There are shuttle bus which takes tourist to Agra and back.
Q68_R24_C2 Good

Q68_R24_C7 Good
You can take a taxy from the Airport itself. There is a paid taxi stand supervised by Delhi Traffic police. You have to pay first to the Counter there & They will give you a receipt for that. after reaching your destination safely just handover that receipt your Taxi driver. if he shows that receipt back in Delhi airport taxi counter then only he get his money. Its very safe becos police have all records of the taxi drivers with them.

What are the taxis like in Doha and elsewhere in Qatar? First; do they use meters (argos) to charge you for the distance traveled; or is every ride a bartering session? Are there any established brands that are known for safety and fairness? Alternatively; should some taxi brands be avoided? Some people have posted here that taxis are hard to find in Doha. How do the telephone-ordered & radio-dispatched taxis work - on time and okay? Thanks.

Only one Company running Taxis in Doha: Karwa and they use meter. 
Q68_R29_C2 Good
The company is called Karwa; the taxis are turquoise/light green color and the tel is 4588888. You can order one by phone; but in the morning or evening (main traffic times) you will not get one most of the times... Anyway; you gotta order some hours in advance. Once you ordered one; they are reliable.
Q68_R29_C3 Good
All Taxis are licensed and they are all same colour; there is usally a minimum charge; from the airport to home etc.     Best thing to do is collect a couple of cards from drivers you like (Ie are clean; courteous etc) and give them a call when you want a lift; I've found the couple of guys I've used always willing for a bit of business; if they are busy they recommend a colleague.
Q68_R29_C4 Good
Metered Taxis are are operated by a co. named KARWA You can book a call taxi by dialling : 4588888;  Meter starts at Qr.4/- for the first km and for every 50 metres an additional Qr.0.25 dirhams and finally an additional Qr.4 if car is booked in advance. Karwa has limousines too; Meter starts with Qr.15/- and Qr.10 for advance booking. Wait for the other QLer's to respond too; im not accurate with the rates...

Quality of taxi's are good since most of them are relatively new. Yes; they use meters; ; u have to pay what is fixed. There is no bartering required unless u r driving in an illegal taxi.

I keep hearing that there is a Harley Davidson store somewhere in Doha; but no hotel concierge or any cab driver seems to know where it is.  Does anybody know of the location? 
Q68_R54_C1 Good
Yes there is one the last i remember it was right next to the airport i hope they didnt close it down after creating the new traffic signal. Basically tell the cab driver or limo driver to take you to the airport traffic lights there are only one you cant go wrong. If when you reach the traffic lights the airport is infront of you then you have come from the Ramada/Hilal direction and the Harley store will be directly to your left while you are stopped at the signal you will see the sign and the bikes inside. If however the driver takes the Corneesh road by the sea towards the airport then when you reach the airport traffic light the airport will be to your left. So you tell the driver to turn right on the traffic light like he is going towards the Mall; and you will see the harley store on your right as soon as you turn right on the traffc light. It is right next to two cargo shipping companies one of them called Ali-Bin-Ali. So its in between the airport traffic lights and the Mall R.....

Q68_R54_C7 Good
The shop by the airport is indeed still open and doing business (yep they still sell bikes and souvenirs). The Al Wakra store is easy to get to; at the airport lights (heading to the airport from the D ring) turn right and keep going; you will reach Al Wakra withing 10-15 minutes dependant on traffic and how heavy your right foot is. On the left hand side of the second roundabout (the one with fountain and clam shaped thing) you will find the new HD shop; also a Kawasaki shop. You're born; you take s**t. You get out in the world; you take more s**t. You climb a little higher; you take less s**t. Till one day you're up in the rarefied atmosphere and you've forgotten what s**t even looks like.

Doha airport does not meet international standards. After your Qatar Airways plane has landed; you can expect the following : a 15-20 minute scenic bus ride to arrive at the airport building; expect to wait 30 to 60 minutes to pass passport control; wait for the scan of your handluggage; pick up your luggage; then wait 15-20 minutes for a taxi. When you leave Doha you can expect the following : check-in time is 20 minutes; wait 20-30 minutes for the passport control in area that is too small and noisy; enter the departure hall; try to find a seat; people are sleeping on the floor; not enough toilets and the one that you will find will be very dirty; wait for the bus; 15-20 bus ride to your plane.

Stick to a Nissan ; Toyota or Mitsubishi; even though you might have to spend a tad more or settle for a lower model than the chevy or hyundai. You'll benefit from the low maintenance costs and good resale value.

"The Charger is a great car if youre looking for what I call a ""Power Sedan"" Its got enough space to be practical; and enough power to be fun. Id also recommend you the Challenger dont be fooled by the door count; its massive; and practical; while still ridiculously fast. Whichever one you go for; please do us muscle car fans a favor; and get nothing less than an RT especially the srt-8 model. you;ll be real satisfied with it. most people that get the cheaper versions wish they had gone for the extra cost and got the better more model. those 6 cylinder models are just embarassing to see on the streets. The bloodline of that car is STRICT muscle."
Q69_R19_C5 Good
It is wiser to get a care that is more common in the market as service parts will be more available; cheaper and most garages would be familiar with the vehicle. But if you have money to burn go ahead and get the Dodge

Q69_R19_C7 Good
Camaro vs. Mustang vs. Charger - Big V8 engines with lots of muscle around them :) For me there is nothing that beats a Mustang. Ford knows how to build their cars. Especially if its a FORD mustang shelby gt500. But be mindful; all of them are like tamed wild animals to keep. They cost you high and are pretty moody too. But Mustang will give you less troubles in daily routine driving. If only Camaro could loosen their suspension and its V8 engine did not sound like its choking all the time; it would have given the Mustang a very strict competition.

Can someone recommend me a good arabic course? Preferrably with personal lessons; not a group; or a group of max. 2-3.
Q70_R17_C1 Good
Hello; I'm an american here on a fellowship to study Arabic at Qatar University. Unfortunately it is too late to enroll in classes there and class sizes are usually pretty big. I; however; have been studying Arabic for a long time and am basically fluent; I'm here to perfect my language skills. If you are looking for a private tutor I am available everyday after 2pm. My Arabic is quite good and as a non-native speaker I'm very familiar with how non-natives learn the language. I have teaching experience. if you are interested please email me. amyrusky@gmail.com Hope to hear from you Amy

Amy; thank you for your answer. I however would prefer a native speaker. The reason being is that if I will start learning Arabic with you; I will inevitably acquire your accent; and this is something I would like to avoid. Sorry and thank you very much!
Q70_R17_C4 Good
Hello I recommend you to have lessons plus practice by speaking to Arabic person or group; which will increase your ability to hear and understand some of it; is general language Since I am Arabic; I want to say that Arabic language has basic roles; but the general language accent will vary; depend on the original of the speaker The libanon; egyption; Syrian; Jordanian; and gulfian each have Accent and some unique words so I recommend you to communicate with each and much you can this to reduce the time Any way I am available for any help Regards

Q70_R30_C3 PotentiallyUseful
Dear Sandra; it is always advisable to chek out the legal documents you need when you come to work in a foreign country. You can find out at the labour office what the visa costs and if you have received a work visa you must have received a residence permit too. The residence permit is not cheap so check out if you paid for this too. Make sure that all your documents are up to date and in order otherwise this can be very expensive for you in the end.
Q70_R30_C4 PotentiallyUseful
Long time ago the companies used to pay for the resident permit fee as it was cheap but later when the government increased the fees to almost 1000 the companies complained that it would cost them alot then the government allowed them to collect the fees from their employees instead; so now some companies pay those fees and some collect the fees from their staff and also some share it with the staff.
Q70_R30_C5 Bad
Thanks for the information; i will answer if that price include a resident permit cause i have no idea at the moment. I agree before i came here to pay for all visa charges so i just want to be sure that i am paying the right price. Do you know how much cost if i want change my sponsor ???
Q70_R30_C6 Bad
Thank you; I was not aware of that; the company pays for the visa of all the employees in our company; I hope they do not change that. :) Angelo
Q70_R30_C7 Good
"At the most; (I just checked) your visa costs should be about 1.300 QR including the work permit. Perhaps he also took money for the ticket (or did you buy this yourself). However; if you want to change your sponsor you can do this only after one year and this has a great deal of difficulties connected to it. a) Your present sponsor may not be happy about this and may not allow you to leave - in this case he will cancel yor visa and you will get a two year ban from working here unless the law has changed recently. b) He can agree and let you work for another company with what is called a ""letter of no objection"" and then later you can change sponsorship. You will have to talk with the sponsor anyway to clear this. Perhaps the next company will pay your visa fees."

canarybird my wife and I are moving to Qatar. I have an offer from QP. I am not sure if my wife is considered under QP sponsorship or mine ( we are moving to qatar together Qo is applying for work visa for both of us at the same time). I want to know if my wife finds a job in Qatar; she will have to get a letter of no objection from Qp? is she considered under my sponsorship? Also; I sent all the docs to QP so they can apply for visa. also; I did my medical last months in Doha; do you how long it takes to get work visa?
Q70_R30_C9 Bad
I have explained that in another thread..that getting a visa is not an issue with QP..They can get it in a few days..but your mobilization will depend upon the date set by your department... Your wife will be on your visa..and it has nothing to do with QP..if she is flying in with you then she will be given a visit visa to fly in and when your Resident permit is stamped..she will be transferred to your sponsorship and resident permit will be stamped on her passport.. Companies have no business of objecting to your spouse work..However you will need approval from the Labour department before your wife can start work.(Not a major problem if your wife lands a job..her company will arrange approvals.. I hope I have answered your query.. Regards

Thanks Tg I have been waiting for visa for three weeks now !! I assumed that It is me who sets the date for the relocation.

all of them are rude. Most of them are really nice; or at least I met with the nice ones; or didn't really had any trouble with them. But I guess it's from their culture.

Qatar is very small island may be 150 X 150 KM. Three sides’ water and oil below the ground. Can this small land take the weight of such massive structures likely to come up in form of stadium; hotels; houses and 100 thousand visitors during world cup? Can it sink?

Hi Could you ladies please let me have feed back with regards to your lifestyle and living standrads in Doha. Do you enjoy living there? Whats it like to live there? If you had a choice would you like to be living Qatar; Abu Dhabi or Dubai? My husband has been offered a job in Doha and he is unsure if he should accept. Any help or advice about Doha would be a great help. Thankyou Sandra
Q71_R8_C1 Good
I like Doha better then Dubai; because is more quiet city and I got everything I need here. I have wonderful life back home; I have my family; friends and places to hangout/enjoy. But once I settled here; all changed but good changed. It just different and I somehow can appreciated the Differences.
Q71_R8_C2 Good
I'm not enjoying my stay here coz we have curfew; we have to work;work and work.That's why we are so sad and bored..I'd like to go to Dubai.

Q71_R8_C3 Good
its quiet; but you can find things to do if you really want to. Now..being happy will depend on a lot of things; to be honest. Are you single..do you have a very active night life...etc... I don't have a curfew..I think that might depend upon what job you have and the requirements. Active night life..there is one but its limited. I see you are from the UK..will be honest with you and say its nothing like the pub scene back there. Clubs and pubs are located ONLY in hotels. Easy to get around if you drive..but you have to be aggressive in your driving manner and defensive...;) I just like it here; for many many reasons...but you DO need to look at all the perspectives before coming here. ONE main one is that the riyal is pegged to the dollar..NOT the English Pound...
Q71_R8_C4 Good
I am here because my husband. He is my sponsor. I have work but I dont change my sponsorship. I can leave the company anytime I want and leave the country anytime I want. I have friends around keep me busy. I have solon to pampered my self. I go to nice restaurant when I miss home; I went to clubs when I want dancing. I can find all I need here in Doha. Dubai is nice and bigger City then Doha. Sure the Malls there got more to offer but so much traffic just to go one place to another. Doha is better in my opinion for living. Dubai only for shopping.

Q71_R16
I'm moving to Qatar next week; and I was wondering how strict Qatar airways are with their 20kg allowance? I think I might be 1 to 2 kilos overweight; will they charge me for that? Also; if anyone knows; does your hand luggage get weighed too? They say you can take 7 kg there. I'm hoping to squeeze in some more! Any comments welcome! Thanks in advance!
Q71_R16_C1 PotentiallyUseful
You'll probably get away with 21kg; but less likely with 22kg. And they quite often weigh the hand luggage. Note also that the dimensions for hand luggage on QA is smaller than on some other airlines (BA for example).
Q71_R16_C2 Good
It really depends on where you are flying from and who is at the check in desk. I've noticed they the sometimes do make you put your handluggage on the belt to see the weight as well but often they don't. I feel you are more likely to get away with heavies handluggage if you don't have too much over 20kgs in your check in luggage. And not to offend anyone or to imply they aren't treating everyone the same way but i do have the feeling they are sometimes a bit more flexible with certain people. No real advice for you sorry. Just make sure you are prepared to pay for your extra kgs and if you are lucky you won't have to pay anything. 1 or 2 extra will go through i would guess. More than that... you'll end up paying.I've flown Emirates a lot and they've let me go through with 5 kgs too much but they made me pay when i only has 2 kgs too much. The 2 kgs was flying from Birmingham; 5 kgs from Dusseldorf. It's always a gamble I'm afraid. Good luck!!!
Q71_R16_C3 PotentiallyUseful
They can let go of 2-4 Kgs easily but more than this will cost you.
Q71_R16_C4 PotentiallyUseful
I was once asked to put my carry on on the scales at Doha - it weighed in at 15Kg! I removed my laptop (a big bugger) and was OK. You ARE allowed your 1 carry on (7kg) PLUS a laptop or camera bag - it's amazing what you can cram in those! Also; if you are bringing a coat; wear it or carry it - you'll get away with that too (pack the pockets!)

Good one about the jacket. I always do that as well. I also always have one carry on and a smaller bag which i use for a book and my passport and i make sure i stuff it with other things as well. They weigh your carry on but the other one they always forget. I always say my little suitcase is annoying to open 50 times for my reading book and passport and things so i keep it seperate. It's not much but i'm sure if you weigh it it will come up to 2 or 3 kgs. And when moving.... every kilo counts.

Christmas trees became popular among the general population about 1850. 2 President Franklin Pierce (1804-1869) arranged to have the first Christmas tree in the White House; during the mid-1850's. President Calvin Coolidge (1885-1933) started the National Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony on the White House lawn in 1923. 4 Today; the Christmas Tree has become accepted by Christians; by people of other faiths; and for those who do not follow an organized religion.

Would openly list countries where homosexuality is outlawed to be a vagabond nations. The matter of homosexuality is by far a much disputed affair among people of various religions; creeds and races; that to simply state it's right and all those who condemn it for any reason is wrong; will not be as simple. That said if they wish to protect those who are gay and transgenders from oppression and mistreatment then I suppose they have all the liberty to do so; however yes they should also then open their eyes to all the oppression committed around the world at large;and work towards stamping them out; and not just pick and choose to their convenience which has clearly been the case with UN in the recent times; which has caused people around the globe to hold them in contempt for; and not take them seriously.

About the article: I cannot comment on its accuracy; as I don't speak or havent learned arabic. The point was more that the website looked a lot less like an institute and a lot more like a blog; dressed up as an institute.

That's a cop out Jabba!! The article is in English. You don't have to know Arabic to understand the article. BTW I don't remember ever claiming that the website was an affiliated to Oxford Univeristy or anything like that. You seem to be more keen on deligimizing the website rather than engaging with the content of the amazing article in it; which leads to the conclusion that you really do not want people to read the articles.

The truth is not all Arabs can speak classic Arabic fluently .

I was there with friends and NO it wasn't a shark! It was Dolphins playing and swimming along. I was there playing volleyball; and I know the difference between sharks and dolphins. if you saw the dorsal fin and looked at it; you would have seen it was dolphins... and if you saw them come up for breaths; then you would know that sharks don't come up for breaths. so... let's not create an unnessecary hype that might scare people from the beach. all you really need to worry about at sealine right now; are the jellyfish and the crazy drivers!

We (3 families) are planning to visit any beach. We have never been at any beach yet. So we will not swim at all; just sit; eat; chit-chat there. So which beach is recommended where there are some facilities like shades; food; drinking water; rest-rooms; etc? We heard about Dukhan but some ppl were saying that road is not good now a days. We are confused at all. Please help us out in this regard.

Q72_R37_C4 Good
If you are a Resident here in Qatar; you should see the Country. It's not big so you can cover it pretty easily. Get yourself a Map and also the Marhaba book; take your friends with you and drive; there are numerous nice beaches around in Qatar that are accessible with a normal Sedan. Sealine which is mentioned by others are maybe not the most impressive beach for some; but it is ok. It is not far away so go there first. Then on other weekends travel to Dukhan; Al Ruwais; Al Khor Etc; to see for yourself. You will not find any facilities at any of the beaches so keep that in mind. (except inside the Sealine Beach Resort)

Q72_R37_C7 Good
Go to Shamal; its superb. The park has basic facilities such as rest room; shades etc. You dnt need to swim; u can sit in one of those boats (free of charge :P) n chit chat in the cool breeze while the boat is floating to the light waves (dnt worry; its anchored n the water is only knee high). You can simply walk into the sea for around a km; its just knee depth for so long. Not too crowded like mesaeed n ofcourse no need to pay a cent unlike sealine n got plenty of space to sit; eat n hv a nap in the garden. Take ur food n water. If u take old khor road n follow ruwais/shamal directons given on roads; u'll reach shamal. Ask anyone there; where the park is n u r there. Enjoy ur time.

As some of you have suggested; to apply for permanent residency in Canada is pretty straight forward o majority of the cases.  The Green Card is only referring to permanent resident of the States; not Canada.  Also; the color of the card for permanent resident card has been changed to white color many yaers ago though most people still refer to green card. To qualify for Canadian permanent resident visa; you  need to accumulate a total of 67 points (used to be 75 points) which are based on your age; education level; profession; employment status; english proficiency; suitability; and among others.  Just go to the official canadian immigration website as stated above and u will get all the info.  God luck~!

greentea; it's not necessary; but some assistance of the experienced individual might be very helpful! Sometimes everything goes smooth and easy. Sometimes there are hidden problems on the way. Filling up the application is a very first and easiest step of the process. On the other hand; if the information provided in the application form is correct and TRUTHFUL; and based on this information the person is eligible for the immigration process; it shouldn’t be any issue with that.. but sometimes some unpredictable things happen.. here is the example. 5 points are given for the relatives in Canada. Let’s say the applicant has a sister who possesses a Resident status in Canada. While filling in the application; the applicant adds 5 points to his score; and it helps him to get 67 points. But.. once the Immigration Office asks for the documents to prove the claims in the initial application. And then it turns out; that a sister doesn’t live in Canada at all. She lives; let’s say in .....

"Honesty on the application is a different matter. Thats down to morals and common sense. A lawyer or consultant is not all that helpful. If you have questions about the application you can usually find it on the site. If any questions arise the embassy will call you. Also dont believe them when they say their clients never get interviews; these are also random and if you are on the up and up no worries. A lawyer/consultant will cost you between 2000-3000 $.

I would strongly suggest you skip the recruiter. You can fill in all the documents on your own - look for the Canadian embassy in Kuwait in Google and you will find all that you need there. Unless you have lots of money; skills that are in demand (and papers to prove your qualifications); or are a refugee; it is very difficult to get in to Canada. It can take years for the papers to get through so if someone has told you 10 months; that is probably completely unrealistic.

I need police clearance for immigration to canada; please advice recently I am fined for no parking with 3 black points; does it have any impact. Do I have to approach Chamber of Commerce before going to Salwa road and need any letter from Employer... Further; what about the forms do they available there in the police clearance office. Can any one post the total procedure.......
Q73_R41_C10 PotentiallyUseful
don't worry about the no parking ticket it will not affect your PCC. For PCC to canada;just go to the CEID with your passport and passport copy ;QID COPY ;ID picture and an ATM (DEBIT CARD) for payment. no need for letter of employment. tell them you need it for canada immigration.

"I don't understand the question. Surely you must have decided before you apply WHY you want to go to a particular country. If it is just to have a ""western"" passport who cares? Canada is cold for much of the year; Austalia is warmer but has some ""hotspots"" sometimes. This is not a very specific question. To be honest. If you are going to any other country other than to reside there permanently. You are not emigrating for legitimate reasons. You are emigrating to get the passport - what is the matter with your birth country's passport?"

I hope both Canada and Australia will start differ those who wants to live in the country from those who wants to get a passport...
Q73_R63_C7 PotentiallyUseful
Every country is getting strict on their immigration... Recently Australia has announced some insane changes in their immigration policies.... Every country requires that one should live in its country but people use to live anywhere else after getting immigration. Now they realized and changed their policies and forcing immigrants to live in the country otherwise they will not renew the residency... But I was thinking if they do not increase their birth rate and skill sets; they have to soften their policies for immigrants :)

Q73_R63_C9 Good
Very much depend on your reason for migrating. Is it economic opportunity; education; life styles and anything else not the least; which country will accept you. As general rule; for economic migrants (I assume you are; apology if wrong) from Ghana (Your profile); both are good. Never live in Canada so I can not comment but for Australia as someone else mention; there are a bit of resistance from earlier migrant (after all Australian aside from the indigeous people are migrants or convicts at some stage of history) about allowing more to come. Basically it affect mid level skilled person/tradesman such as cooks; hairdresser; carpenter; electricians etc. For higher qualifications (engineers; doctors); I believe the door is still open. Cheers SK BTW; if you decide to go to Australia; you DO NOT need to enggage the service of a migration agent. They mostly act as an administrative assistant (ie. reminding you of which document to submit etc) and have no impact on your selectibility.
Q73_R63_C10 Bad
Qatarisun and Marycatherine … are you trying to give me bad impression about Canada people or what? I think you are trying to do that but you cannot because you do not represent Canada people in this forum. Actually I know some good people from Canada and they told me more about Canada. But I just asked this question to hear from foreigners who lived in Canada before or still living there. This is because foreigners experience in a country cannot be the same as that of citizens. I am wondering why you think I want to immigrate to Canada….. Or go there for passport …where didn’t I mention that? It is very funny hahaa Does my question about immigration mean that I want to immigrate to Canada? Why don’t you that it could be research purpose or any other thing else? I don’t think we should think one way! Especially when we have job tiles like teacher or manager etc …….we shouldn’t think like someone who hasn’t been to school. I want to repeat again …don’t judge peop.....
Q73_R67
We're interested in having our baby in Canada. I'd like to see if anyone out there has done it too.
Q73_R67_C1 Good
"There is no such thing as birth tourism in Canada. In fact; you will probably either be denied a visa or turned away at immigration if there is any suspicion that you are there solely to give birth. This is an immigration ""scam"" because Canada confers nationality on children born in Canada - but reserves the right to deport the parents. Be very careful. There have been cases where the baby gets to stay; but the parents have to leave."
Q73_R67_C2 Bad
Why don't you have your baby in your country?
Q73_R67_C3 PotentiallyUseful
"Another issue; how about the hospital costs. Just to ""sit"" in a hospital bed as a non-Canadian costs about CAD1500/day (on a ward with 9 other people - not being seen by a doctor; no food; no medicine; no treatment). That's nearly 5000QAR/day before treatment. Can you afford this?"
Q73_R67_C4 Bad
do such thing exist?
Q73_R67_C5 Good
Yes it DOES exist and it still is legal to have your baby both in the States and Canada as a visitor.Anyone who is born in USA and Canada is automatically deemed to be citizen regardless of the parent's status or residency or citizenship. There are such agencies back home in Hong Kong; Singapore and Seoul. Just type it on google I am sure you'll find a few...Young Asian couples are really into this idea. In fact; my younger sister did it in Canada about a year ago. So my niece has become Canadian by birth and has gotten a Canadian passport. Neither my brother-in-law nor my sister were Canadian resident or citizen at the time of birth. The OB-GYN; the housing and the hospital all cost them around 30.000USD. They did it in Toronto and stayed in a furnished home for three months. My sis said everything went good and that they never were treated badly just because they happen to have a baby there as non-residents. So I think it's for sure worth doing if you want the US or Canadian citizens.....
Q73_R67_C6 Good
It is NOT legal to operate as a birth tourism company to have a child in Canada. Canada confers citizenship automatically on babies born there NOT on their parents who CAN and ARE deported; thereby separating families. THIS IS A SCAM to try and gain access to Canadian citizenship by circumventing the immigration rules and regulations by having a baby in Canada. Immigration in Canada is well aware of this and do take steps to circumvent it. Again; I ask; why don't you want YOUR child to have YOUR nationality?
Q73_R67_C7 Bad
We just want the citizenship for our baby. We think we can offer the costs that come with this. BTW; I am well aware of the fact that only my baby gets the citizenship by birth NOT us;the parents. So In this case; there is no scam that I get dragged into.
Q73_R67_C8 PotentiallyUseful
I would be very careful; Canada Immigration does not look kindly on those who try to get citizenship for their children in this way. They will be asking hard questions at the immigration desk and if you can't answer them; you're on the next plane out.

We've got several club houses with heaps of facilities like gym; swimming pool; basketball & tennis court.. and much more. The community also has its own supermarket; hospital (it's huge!!); nurseries...etc. I've met a few Aussie teachers there in Al Khor International school (also inside the compound). In the weekends people usually go to Doha city.. which takes only 25-30 minutes by car. The community also provides shuttle buses inside the compound; and shopping buses that takes you to different places/stops in Doha city. Hope this helps :)

MES - doesnt have Airconditioned buses...the buses are airconditioned but are not only of poor quality but also the air is not cooled enough & it is  very uncomfortable for the children . Birla school in comparison has new airconditioned & curtained (windows) minibuses. That in itself is reason enough to put your kids there.  Education wise both are good....Birla is on the pricey side while MES is the cheapest Indian school. Good thing about MES is they have good sport facility with tennis and basketball courts and atheletic track. Another good thing is they even admit Pakistani kids.

Hi everyone; we're relocating to Doha with my family (me; my wife; one son and pets) and planning to be in country by mid-June. My housing allowance is roughly 12;000 rials a month and ot´s include the vehicle. What does this exactly buy us in terms of a villa and an car rent ? This value is enough ? Roberto

Maybe villas are a bit less in areas that are not so nice. But my friend lives off D ring in an area that is like a ghetto she is paying 10;000 QR and the Landlord is threatening to raise the rent double after she spent 30;000 QR to fix it up. I can tell people are going to have to rent flats although the new ones are tiny and expensive.
Q74_R78_C4 Good
15;000 - 20;000 to rent a villa in a good compound or even a nice stand-alone. Housing is very; very expensive here. I must say that 12 is very low for a family. I would estimate about 2;000/month for a car rental. ************************************* Be kinder than necessary; for everyone you meet is fighting some kind of battle.

if your looking for a flat/apartment....its....QR8000-QR12000..thats pretty reasonable... if you are going in for a villa.....its nothing less than QR 15000 and the price could go up to QR 30000 for a very good one too....

"""one book store"" is slightly unfair. You'll find a selection of popular cheap paperbacks at Carrefour; Lulu Hypermarket and some of the self-styled ""bookshops"".

On 'normal' amazon setup; if you go to Amazon and go to kindle store; it will show that it in not available in Qatar. A great pity especially since we do not have a proper bookshop......

Does anyone know how good a delivery service you get in Qatar with Amazon books? It might sound a strange question; but as an avid reader; I can't do without my books. I have taught in six different countries and in two I received less than a third of my Amazon orders.

"I think it's better if you post this under ""Questions"". I heard that Amazon needs a US address for delivery.

I figured that delivery to the Gulf would be expensive. It might be a good idea; then; for me to have books delivered to my UK address and have family send them on. Thanks for the info.
Q76_R38_C5 PotentiallyUseful
Ooh wait; if your family is going to send them on through regular post; it could sometimes take months for your books to get here. My advice is to find a mail forwarding service in the UK. We have one in the US. I order from anywhere; they send the order to my PO BOX in Florida; then the mail forwarding service sends it through DHL and it gets delivered to my husband's office here. It is kind of expensive; but our items get here in 3 to 4 days from leaving Florida. Motherhood...The hardest job you'll ever love! : )

This debate is indeed an endless one. Usually; those who are comfortable in their marriage would always have you believe that it is arranged marriage or love marriage; whatever their specific case; which is better. On the contrary; those who are not happy in their marriage will always claim that the form of the marriage other than they had is better. The fact is that there is simply no way to tell which one is better. For some people love marriage works magic; for others arranged marriage opens the heaven's door. To a large extent; it luck.

Q77_R30_C3 PotentiallyUseful
First; you have to be 100 % sure if you are preggy or not. Go to the hospital a.s.a.p so you can have a pregnancy blood test. Better go early so you can wait for the result within 1-2 hours. They will ask you prior to that if you are married the say YES; since you are really married right? 2nd - Does your employer knows that your husband is in town or not? If they know that he is here; then leave it as it is. Have you mention to your employer or interviewers before that you are married? Or have submitted a marriage contract as part of the HR formalities?.. Then leave it again. Then just go on with your pregnancy and do your best to invite your husband to come back in DOHA. Further; Make sure that you are living with your trusted friends or relatives to avoid rumors; etc.

"'kaliwali""... don't be scared; We are only allowed to be scared to GOD and no one else. You go to Phil. Embassy and apply for the authentication of ur Marriage Contract. Then go to Qatar Ministry (somewhere in Corniche) sorry can't figure out the exact name of this gov't agency. Show them the authenticated marriage contract and they will stamp that contract (arabic text). So at least you are protected with that paper. Anytime somebody ask you then just show the paper;to keep their mouth shut. Keep on praying don't stress yourself too much as you are entering the most memorable and exciting stage of womanhood. Just trust and believe in GOD. It's not easy but you must do something as early as now. Hope this will help you."

Q79_R7_C4 Good
You are totally free to wear whatever kind of shoes you want. The style of shoes that women were here may be different than our style but it is just a fashion thing; no rules. But just have in mind that the AC in the offices is often working with maximum power and if you are a cold hand/feet person you will dream of closed toe shoes (personally I was dreaming of woolen socks:-) and it was in June!!! Just bring a little of both and do not worry you can find shops here to complete your collection (Nine West...)
Q79_R7_C5 Good
trust me; you cannot outdo the Qatari women in the shoe department! They have the most amazing shoes ever!! How they walk in some of them; with the abaya on; is a phenomenon I haven't mastered yet but am working on it! So..bring whatever shoes you like...and wear them!!

Q79_R7_C8 Good
You can wear ANY shoes you like here; and there are some great shoe shops too. Agree with Scarlett about Qatari women's shoes - some of them are works of art; and they are SO high it probably explains why they have such a sedate; slow walk! Oh; and why their drivers have to stop right outside the Mall to pick them up!! Enjoy!

hi to all:) I'm coming to Doha on 14th September; and i'm wondering what temperature there is during the winter. How many degrees are there? Is it cold in December and January? Should i take any warm sweaters with me? ( lool i'm really chilly person:)) Cheers!
Q79_R12_C1 Good
it wont be snowing; but you do sometimes need to switch ur heater on :D
Q79_R12_C2 Good
You're from Poland! I'm sure you can handle winter here. last year it went down up to 14 degrees. but it's already too cold for me; I have to wear winter clothes with globes and boots.
Q79_R12_C3 Good
Last year I heard the temperature was 9 degrees. Hehe; it won't be cold; but you need a thin coat especially in the evenings. And it's raining sometimes; too.
Q79_R12_C4 Good
Winter in DOha is splendid. The climate is mild during the day and cold if the wind blows. It is real cool at night. No snow except your freezer ice maker. Cardinal OF QATAR LIVING
Q79_R12_C5 Good
thin coat bet you now you wear that thin coat here in winter specially in dunes at night its totally like a freezer i couldnot step out of my car and turned that damn heater on full mode and the moment i would step out the cool breeze went through out my soul. Where as i belong to a place where there is snow and extremly cold temp might drop even to -5 sometimes. but this winter here in Qatar is kinda strange. [img_assist|nid=21285|title=.|desc=|link=none|align=left|width=180|height=180]
Q79_R12_C6 Bad
well.... So i see that warm clothes are needed during the winter. i've always considered Qatar as really hot country. And probably it is but only during the summer... So average temperature in winter is about 14 C? sunny?
Q79_R12_C7 Good
temp can drop to 10 or 8 also here. yea its sunny and its cloudy also and raisn too and when it rains then the temp drops. last year all the outlet in Qatar were runout of Heaters. they had to import thousand of them from Dubai. [img_assist|nid=21285|title=.|desc=|link=none|align=left|width=180|height=180]
Q79_R12_C8 Good
it kinda gets pretty cold. As DaRuDe said; 8 to 10 degrees. This may sound high; but when it rains or there is a wind; it feels much colder. I will second DaRuDe; last year; there was a shortage of room heaters in Qatar; people were even willing to pay a premium for a small one. Better to be prepared than spend sleepless night shivering with the cold. Granted the cold snap does not last long; but who would want to give up their sleep. Days are pretty warm. Last year; I think; it was about a day or three that was very cold during the day and that was due to heavy rains.
Q79_R12_C9 Good
I remember last winter was so cold but I didn't have any heaters; so I had to cover up in thick blankets lol. Doesn't help that I had tile flooring as well. In general though; Winter time is usually great for me. I think the weather can be perfect. __________________________ Cost of Living; Visas; Saftey Info; Tips on Moving; Facts; Pictures; Videos; and more!

Q79_R13
My family and I are moving to Qatar next year. We lived in Saudi 10 years ago. A co-worker said expat men and women can wear shorts in public in Qatar. I find that extremely difficult to believe. What's the truth? Thanks; Kevin in Houston
Q79_R13_C1 Good
Yes; you can wear shorts; just not really short indecent shorts. They should be to the knee and shoulders need to be covered ie no singlet tops for either men or women however many ex-pats do flout this.
Q79_R13_C2 PotentiallyUseful
Are you asking if it's in good taste or if it is illegal? Certainly never in good taste except in swimming situations; as for legal; these things are never written in stone in Qatar. I would say not for women and not a good idea for men.
Q79_R13_C3 Good
Yes you can.
Q79_R13_C4 Good
It really depends WHERE in public you go. On your compound or to your kids school is perfectly fine. I see shorts in all the malls. But really; it is considered offensive in this culture; and while you won't get arrested; you will get stared at.
Q79_R13_C5 Good
"All the answers above are correct; Qatar is less conservative than KSA but not nearly as open as UAE or Bahrain. It's a great place in the middle. As a man wear your ""boy pants"" you'll be fine; as a woman same; but more importantly keep the shoulders covered. You'll be comfortable and won't get a second look. Coming from Houston; welcome to the nearest corollary weather-wise...!"
Q79_R13_C6 PotentiallyUseful
If you are an overweight; middle aged heavy drinking and smoking European; I think it is compulsary to wear very short nylon shorts and a muscle vest to the supermarket. seriously; please don't wear shorts to the malls; it IS in bad taste; you would stick out like a sore thumb and give the rest of us a bad name.
Q79_R13_C7 Bad
just don't wear short shorts; we don't want to see the little guy pop out.
Q79_R13_C8 Bad
Wear anything Qatar is not conservative and mad like KSA.
Q79_R13_C9 Bad
Good answers It just depends how much you want to offend people. Number one complaint from the locals is 'indecent clothing'. They don't take tax thus i respect their wishes.
Q79_R13_C10 PotentiallyUseful
Generally; it's not the done thing. However my husband - a carefree sort - wears knee-length shorts to the mall. My teenage son got accosted in a mall when he wore shorts (not by a Gulf Arab; some other Arab national); so I insist he wears trousers now.

My family and I are new here. I packed lightly for my stay; with the intent to purchase a burqa for my outings; out of respect for the culture. However; I am surprised to find so many women not wearing them. Is there a need as long as I am dressed conservatively; or are those not wearing them being disrespectful and simply tolerated?

Hi Go as per what your mind says.
Q79_R29_C2 Good
Welcome to Qatar; if you feel this is decent Dress and more safer; you can wear. either Muslim or not if you wear this dress; you will be respected.
Q79_R29_C3 Good
I'm shocked. You say you're already here. You didn't realise yet that Qatar; sorrily; is a step away from Dubai (or may be Egypt) where you seldomly meet a woman with Niqab (Burqa) It's worthy to express gratitude for respecting the land traditions.

Q79_R29_C8 Good
"tinkerbell; you said; ""if u r not a muslim u need not wear a burka"" Does this mean that Muslimas need to wear a burka or hijab in Qatar? During my short visit I got the impression that Muslim or not; it's each individual's decision (or sometimes her family's or community's decision) and if no veil is chosen (whether for the hair alone/hijab or hair and face/burka/niqab) that modest dress is ok."

Hi all; Are you able to clarify what is considered appropriate attire for females at the beach and gym? Thanks!
Q79_R35_C1 Good
Swimwear at the beach and workout clothes at the gym. Easy; really. Unless of course it's a public beach and you don't see any other females wearing swimwear; then you shouldn't either. Hotel beach is a safe bet! So are the remote areas by the Inland sea.
Q79_R35_C2 Good
Swim ware at the beach.. Bikini; tikinis; swimsuit etc.. only at the privete beaches (like hotels; and other clubs). Not on public beaches (like Wakra beach) Gym ware just as any other gym clothes.. ----------------- HE WHO DARES WINS

You will need a sponsor's letter; return air-ticket; pp photos and fill out the form at the Philippine embassy; I think you get 21 days visit visa and it cost Qr.111/- or there abouts.

"no need for sponsor's letter you can get the visa upon your arrival and they will give you 21 days; but foreigner married to Filipina has 1 year right of stay accompanied by your spouse without your spouse accompanying you; you will only be given 21 days of stay like the other foreigners but it's renewable.

Hope what you are talking about is visit visa or tourist visa which would cost your friend from 500-1000QAR. Those visa can be converted to legal work visa once you find a job.

If there is a will there is a way...you'll save easily considering you will not have your family with you and accommodation has been taken care off. Food outside is cheap too - just incase you suck at cooking. Everyone has a different standard of living - so it is difficult to respond to such queries. Now that you're considering the offer and you have accepted the fact that you'll be away from your family (not sure that is worth QAR 8k); i wish you all the best.

They havent all yet been connected to the ministry of interior's sever. Once I was behind a truck at a signal and I couldnt see whether it was green or red when I was crossing. These huge trucks block the sight of the signals. They have to do something about it. Anyways I would definitely advise people not to jump redlights and slow down at the singals.

not to worry much buddy! if you mistakenly crossed the signal on red light but stopped and reversed back; you will only get fine of qar 500. the main thing they note is that you realized your mistake and corrected there itself. imagine if you crossed the red light but didn't stop thinking that mistake is already done so what's the need of stopping; then you'll get the fine of not less than qar 6000. just be thankful to god that you saved a huge sum of qar 5500 by stopping and reversing back.

hi; check in hukoomi.qa if you have fine. But for sure you will have a fine not for crossing the signal but you hit the white line which is considered as the pedestrian line. Camera will trigger only after you trigger the loop no. 2.

Check with Immigration department for there will be a video recording and they will charged you accordingly.

I think the camera might have flashed for someone else who had crossed the red signal completely which you did not notice. I am staying near the crazy and there are a lot of similar sudden breaks where most of the vehicles are sometimes crossing their front wheels and I have not seen any camera flashes for them. I agree with the rule that he should have stopped his car when he saw the blinking yellow signal.
Q81_R25_C10 Good
No Fine If he only crossed and went through the junction to other end then he will be charged and will have to pay 6000. if he stopped or he tried to reverse back he wont be charged. Happened with me twice in last 8months and i never got any fine to pay or any points.

Don't hate me diamondgirl....this certainly does not apply to everyone....but my personal experience here in doha is that MOST do not speak english. Even people who are not local and come from the subcontinent and claim to speak english do not understand you or prove able to articulate their thoughts in english. I'm not trying to upset anyone; but i'm calling it like I see it. This is a true story: I called the information number provided on the Qatar Foundation website to get some information on the American universities you hear so much hype about; and was shunted through 4 different people who could not speak english! This isn't an obscure gvt office in the ministry of islamic studies or whatever....this was QATAR Foundation!! SO: No! English is not a main language in Qatar...and is mostly spoken by the European and North American Expat communities only. Stay safe all. Perfection does not exist.

Q82_R24_C7 PotentiallyUseful
yes but I argue that they need help from English speakers more than we need them. plus you have to be realistic. Government departments must cater to the entire population so which is more reasonable to have a few people trained to speak english or simply ask the population to change? Governments should be run like a private business. if any business simply refused to take bookings or orders in english because this was an arabic country then they would fail.

My husband fixed it for me so I can listen to proper English all the time. It's a good way to learn. But sometimes it's NOT enough. Sometimes you need an intelligent native speaker discussing different subjects with you. It's very intensive and very effective. Don't be affraid to pick up a dialect. In Alexander Language Center for instance they don't have teachers with strong accents. In fact; I don't know many TEFL teachers with strong accents and I know A LOT of them! Seriously; call 44341014 - 44364425 55387713; do the placement test (it's free); meet the teachers; and decide for yourself. I wish you all the best Lana

Q82_R26_C7 Good
That depends on your personal need for English. Some people even married to native speakers and exposed to the language 24/7 still come to do some conversation classes just to gain some vocabulary on certain subjects and confidence. Besides; I've got the impression that the person who asked the question wants to pick up a bit of an accent as well. Am I right; Mr. Mathew? You can't learn the correct pronunciation through reading the books. Regarding the prices; I don't know Alexander Language Centre prices.

We are weighing up a couple of car options and I'm keen to hear more from drivers of these cars; and their pros and cons. Basically we're tossing up between the new Jeep Cherokee and the new Volvo XC60. Other than the fact that the Volvo is more expensive; which is the better car for Doha? The heat; the safety; resale value; value for money; service and parts; etc?

For some reason; the people of Doha think that Nissan and Toyota make cars; and every other manufacturer makes wheelbarrows with engines... meaning that unless it's a jap car; no one else will buy it after you. For your question... the Volvo by a mile. It is comfortable; will last; the warranty is great; it's luxurious; drives well; and the interior is plush and refined. The other car is just an American thing that uses the same technology as the very first Jeeps manufactured 50 years ago... very little refinement or development. It is corse; uneconomical; and a barge to drive (literally; as it uses a truck chassis; as opposed to the Volvo that actually uses a car chassis). So; the question is; do you want to drive your car for at least 3 to 5 years and sell it for nothing; a car which you will enjoy driving and be kept quite safe in... or is it a financial investment; you want something back on it; and which you may kill you if you crash it (look at a picture of a landcruiser after a .....

If it takes over 2 months (highly unlikely) you could always make a cheap ""visa run"" to dubai; fly back the same day; then you have another month; repeat as necesary! Also its Ramadan coming up on the 1st of August I believe; nothing gets done around that time so they will surely get it all done before that date."

As far as I know and from my experience in our company; a husband cannot get his wife a residency unless after 6 months of stay in Doha; since one of the required documents fo the Immigration is a 6-month bank statement in order to get a Family Residence; or 3-month statement for a Family Visit Visa (valid for 6 months only). In other terms; unless you are sponsored by a company you cannot get a residence untill after six months from your husband's. the toursit visa; suggested supra (going to Dubai every 2 months) would be the only solution...

(might be great I just don't know) So back pain stayed for about 2 weeks.  The option left according to all the searches was to fly to Dubai and spend 625+ per treatment.  Flying to Dubai does not work with my work or recreational schedule.  So I started to search medical resources to understand my problem. This is my problem.  I was not lifting anything heavy; not doing anything fancy or not excercising but hurt my back simply lifting an ordinary object a scsior from my home office desk. i would go on to learn later.....

Some do still live there but I don't know whether villas are still allocated to new staff. The houses are good and; like most compounds here; the recreational facilities provided are quite good (social centre; swimming pool; tennis courts; etc). I am sure that you will be able to live comfortably here. However; if you have pets; make sure that the compound will permit them; some do not.

HI. My husband works for Hamad. We are living in a beautiful villa in a compound full of HMC staff. What is great is that all the husbands; and a couple of wives; work in the same department so they are all generally good friends. The facilities in our comound are limited (pool and gym only) however the social life makes up for it. What i do however; suggest is getting out and meeting other people when you arrive so that you have variety to your day. Contact me if you like. I have a 2 year old son who is always keen for play dates. Best regards; P1x13

Q86_R27_C6 Good
The original Al Zuhoor compound is beautiful - I live just opposite; and the villas look fantastic; very spacious; great clubhouse and lots of greenery. Its close to Villagio and Hyatt Plaza; just off Al Waab street. Al Zuhoor 2 is just round the corner. Not as impressive because its just been completed; so there's little greenery; it looks a bit utilitarian with a lot of dust around and most of the place is empty. The villas too look really squashed close together. But inside they are very nice - my friend was staying there till recently - they're comfortable and spacious. You'll be happy in either compound I'm sure.

Could anyone tell me which is better: compound or stand alone villa? We originally thought we would live in a stand alone but it seems that most expats live in compounds. Is it for security? Or just a matter of preference? I would appreciate any advice. Thanks. Michelle

END OF SERVICE BENEFITS --- GRATUITY --- CALCULATION ? dear QL'ers; i wish to know how is gratuity calculated in Qatar Government/Authority offices. the knowledge i have is that; it should be....... (number of years worked) x (last basic salary) date of joined- 2001
Q87_R35_C1 Good
it is computed at the last basic salary you're receiving. 1 month basic salary per year of service up to a maximum of 10 years. hope this helps :)
Q87_R35_C2 PotentiallyUseful
For ESB calculation; the maximum of 10 years has already been waived meaning you can now work without any limitation of number of years. When the going gets tough; the tough gets going....
Q87_R35_C3 Good
basic salary x 12months / 365days x total no. of days worked = total gratuity...this computation is based on my previous employer.
Q87_R35_C4 Good
Actually the payment is 3 weeks for every year worked; not a month. The Labour Law changed in 2004; previously there was a sliding scale whereby you got more payment for every year that you worked (and the payment was based on full salary not just basic). If you get your hands on the old law you could arugue to your employer that the previous law applied up until January 2005 when the current law was enacted. Worth a shot. Tresgandas your calculation would come out to be the total salary paid; not the EOSB amount.
Q87_R35_C5 PotentiallyUseful
Heartless is right.. it is only 3 weeks pay.. my company gives that to us annually.. i guess it is easier for them than giving us one lump sum after we terminate our employment...
Q87_R35_C6 PotentiallyUseful
And its also cheaper for them; because they give it at the salary you are making at that time rather than the salary when they pay it at the end of your contract with them. you might have been promoted etc.
Q87_R35_C7 Good
Heartless; that labour law requires the EoSB to be calculated on the basis of the last wages paid; which means if you started at QR 100 and are now getting paid QR500/ your EoSB will be on the basis of QR 500/-
Q87_R35_C8 Bad
JB; I am coming across this practice of paying EoSB at the end of every year for the first time; rather strange.
Q87_R35_C9 Bad
Does the 3 weeks per year payment stay the same or increase by years? For example; after 5 years would you receive a 3 week gratuity or a 15 week gratuity? If it is the later; how do companies or schools afford this?
Q87_R35_C10 Good
DC-Jaz - You would receive a 3 week bonus for every year you worked. So if you had worked 5 years you'd get 15 weeks bonus. This assumes the company are paying the bonus at the end of service as they're supposed to; not at the end of each year of service.

Q88_R44_C10 PotentiallyUseful
Yes; there are far less strays around now than there used to be. There was a big clean up program a while back where lots of strays were caught; and if they were injured or had a disease or illness they were put down but if they were healthy they were neutered (and vaccinated I think) and released. People think they're doing good by feeding the strays; when in actual fact they're only making the problem worse. Far better to catch and neuter.

Hi peeps; Its been awhile I dont ask any question here; okay this one is for my friend. She want to know where is salon can provide cellulite treatment??? please give me info. She is dying to do it. Appreciated your response. Thanks in advance.
Q88_R49_C1 PotentiallyUseful
for the most part cellulite treatments are a very temporary thing. Most also don't work...and Ashok...if you haven't mentioned WHICH kind of cellulite treatment is bad for you; since most of them are topical and a massage...there are some invasive ones but those have questionable results also... Dragon..tell your friend to save her money; take USED coffee grounds; massage them into her area that has cellulite; with a circular motion..the caffeine in the grounds constrict the skin and vessels; making it look tighter; plus it has a great exfoliating effect. Grant me the senility to forget the people I never liked;the good fortune to run into the ones I do;and the eyesight to tell the difference.

Showtime has Coronation Street and Emmerdale; yes a few weeks old but apart from at Christmas; it makes no difference. Granada UK has 4 year old Coronation st and Emmerdale.

To be honest; the tv here is not the same as the UK; old episodes of What not to Wear; Homes Under the Hammer etc with the odd drama.

I guess you don't know what is happening around the world these days. India and China are really growing faster than any other economies in the world. Why do you really want the passport of a country where the citizens will never accept you as a part of their society? If you like to get the passport of another country why don't you try USA; UK; Canada or Australia because after that you will be definitely be treated better than an Indian here. Try to be a proud Indian and try to know about the real value of your country.

Q89_R38_C4 Good
Many people experience shocks when they get out of their car. Often they believe that the car is charged - but this is not normally so. Sitting in the car; electrostatic charges are generated on the car seat and the person's body; due to contact and movement between the clothes and the seat. When the person leaves the seat; They take half of this charge with them. As they get out of the vehicle; their body voltages rises due to this charge - a voltage of 10;000 Volts is not unusual. When they reach to touch the vehicle door; the electrostatic discharge and shock occurs as their hand approaches the metal door. The voltage build-up can often be avoided by holding onto a metal part of the door frame as you leave the seat. This provides a return dissipation path for the charge on your body. If you have forgotten to hold the metal door part as you leave the seat; a shock may often still be avoided by touching the glass window before you touch the metal door. The glass may be conductive enou.....

Fly Dubai really sucks. Their airport staff seems to have no clue about Dubai immegration procedures and can easily ban any passenger from boarding. the airport counter has no supervisor to talk to; in case of any conflict and their main office staff are worse in cooperation. I had a similar situation where they did not allow me to board as my RP had only 2.5 months expiry date. I purchased a ticked on Qatar Airways and got an arrival visa at Dubai without any problem. Fly Dubai was not convinced and they seemed did not want to listen and escaped from paying back the ticket cost. I desided to use a good reputed carrier even with double or tripple ticket fare rather than facing such irresponsible situation at the last moment.

It may be a little more expensive; but since we had to include original documents; we went with a name we knew and trusted (and could track our shipments progress online).

Q91_R10_C10 Good
I don't recall the exact amount (I believe the downloadable forms have the exact amounts stated on them); but I do remember that it had to be a certified cheque made out to the Receiver General for Canada. I also mailed it (using Fed Ex); and crossed my fingers. All in all it did turn out to be rather painless; just took a little time (total of about 4 weeks; give or take a day). Btw this is all the new and difficult regulations that required the passposrts to be issued directly from Canada (before that; the embassies used to do it). I remember for instance my parents renewed theirs (the time before last) at the embassy in Beirut about 7 years ago. The whole process took like 5 working days (whereas this last time again had to be done by mail and took around 4 weeks). Good luck to whoever is renewing theirs; and stay safe all.

Go onto your embassy's website & get the picture info from that. Print it and take that with you to the photo shop. I went to the Kodak shop at Ramada (next to Chili's) They will then prepare your pictures accoring to the new rules.

Pictures for biometric passports are no different than any standard passport picture. Whatever the specs are on the application; just as with your previous passports. There are no such thing as biometric pictures. Biometric passports mean they have data embedded in a chip in the passport pages. Sah?

Sameerah; I want to live in a Gulf Arab; Muslim-majority country (Again; I will state as I have countless times to others; I am fully aware that Qatar is not a perfect country with people that are 100% traditional Arab Muslims; but it is pretty close!). Qatar is beautiful and has a rich Bedouin history. I love my Arab Culture; and I really hate Western culture and ways. I feel really uncomfortable living in a coutry filled with Western kuffar. I am a traditional Arab who wants to live an Islamic lifestyle; and here in America; its becoming very difficult and problemaic to do what I love. And I practice what I preach; too. I wear Thobe and Ghutrah; I pray in public when I have to; and my apartment here basically looks like a Bedouin tent already! I am DYING to go to Qatar!

thread and needles - ended up getting family to ship it in size 15 shoes - actually found some adidas at City Center. Probably the last time that will ever happen Anything large in size to fit us taller/larger americans. I literally can't shop at Villagio or City Center for clothes; I just gave up. Every store seems to cater to the smaller asian people; which makes sense because thats the main population here anyways. Just sucks for the US expaits; we like to shop too you know! Decent used car. They either have 1.7 billion miles on them or they're ragged out; or the owner wants a crazy price for the crappy disposable car (like a honda city for example). Activites to get to know other people/races. I can never find anything to do to meet new people.

Visas on arrival (100 QR) can be renewed once (for an additional 100QR) then you have to leave the country and return (Bahrain Air has fares in the range of 411 QR). I'm not sure if a tourist visa obtained through a hotel can be renewed though. You can try renewing it at the Immigration Office near the airport. If you do; great; if not; Bahrain has a great First Class lounge--far surpassing the public bus terminal called the Silver Lounge at DIA.

Yes obviously if you will make it like a novel will be a plus because then no one will read it only; your picture will do whatever it need to do.

Ive heard that this school has over 3000 on a waiting list. That cant be true. Schooling is a real problem for us. We want places for January do we have a chance with any British schools. Our kids are very sporty and we are from the UK. What about compass??? Any advice gratefully accepted.
Q94_R84_C1 PotentiallyUseful
Compass is a relatively new venture. My daughter is a year 6 student at Compass. We are delighted with her progress. In my opinion it is well worth contacting Compass to enquire about spaces particularly as Doha College and Park School are over subscribed. If your kids are successful at gaining a place at Compass; you could always put their names on the waiting list for those other schools - In the mean time they will be getting a first class education at Compass. You may however be so pleased with Compass that you decide to keep them there!!
Q94_R84_C2 Good
3;000 on a waiting list can't be true. That's several times the size of the school and probably about the size of the entire British school-age population in Doha. Compas is a good alternative as is Sherborne. In fact; by reputation they are in the same group as Park House.
Q94_R84_C3 Good
I honestly think that this school is unethical to charge a large fee to apply then sending a letter stating the school is full. Just imagine what the owners of this school is thinking about you as a parent.
Q94_R84_C4 Good
Any place you can get coming into the country is valuable. Academically Park House takes the kids who fail the Doha College exam.........say no more. But its OK for average ability kids. I agree with the other posters that taking your money to apply when they no full well that there is no chance of a place is so wrong. Especially as your application is only valid for a year and you will be expected to keep repaying every year you are on the list.
Q94_R84_C5 Good
HI ; JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT PARKHOUSE IS THE BEST SCHOOL IN DOHA HENCE THE WAITING LIST HOWEVER 3000 1S A LITTLE EXTREME ; IT'S A VERY FRIENDLY BUT DISCIPLINED SCHOOL . MY SON HAS GONE FROM YEAR 6 TO YEAR 12 AT PARKHOUSE AND HAS 1 YEAR LEFT BEFORE HE GOES TO UNIVERSITY . PARKHOUSE WOULD ALWAYS BE MY PREFERENCE OVER DOHA COLLEGE AS IN MY OPINION DOHA COLLEGE IS A BREEDING GROUND FOR MANY EXPAT. BRATS!! REGISTRATION FEE AT PARKHOUSE IS 200 QR AND FEES FAR LESS THAN DOHA COLLEGE . TRY DOHA BRITISH SCHOOL AS A STOP GAP .

"I was also concerned about waiting lists. I am due to move end August with my 2 children aged 9 and 16 years. My husband is already there. I like yourself was very concerned about school reputation etc and had myself chewed about school places; or should I say lack of them. I applied to Doha College; Park House and DESS initially; I am pleased to say my children have both been offered places at Parkhouse. My 16 year old was interviewed at Easter and my son secured his place 3 weeks ago. My advice is apply and wait. There are many anxious parents out there who simply wont wait and use another school; therefore moving you up on the waiting list. Once one child gains a place; it wont be long before their sibling does. I totally agree with Yazleb on home tuition. We were moving regardless of school places and I was more than prepared for home tuition until places at ""The Right School"" became available.

Gelana - you made a good move with Park House. I know exactly what you mean about Doha College. When you phone up to enquire about your application you get a different answer. My friend kept being told she had no chance die to the plethora of siblings that had prority - Fine she thought - then when one of her kids got in ( for sixth form) she was told that there was no such thing as sibling priority and that it was all done on ability - but they refused to test her kid; who had straight A's from DESS. With respect to the year 7 'open exam' two virtually rememdial kids got places - because they were good swimmers - fine - but the mantra the DC preaches is that ' we are only interested in academic ability in terms of deciding whether to accept pupils' - by the way both kids had parents who are teachers at DC!

As for taxis; it seems like most think it may be difficult to rely on them but can't I liase with a taxi driver (i.e. exchange phone numbers) and call him when I need him. That's what happened when I was in Kuwait/Egypt for 6 months and it wasn't considered a chauffeur service.
Q96_R12_C9 Good
Since Lynnie is off somewhere; I'll answer :) Liasing taxis can be a hassle; people have had problems with that for example he said he wasn't free; or he was too late to pick them up; etc. So having a car would be much more convenient and probably cheaper. As for the car; u can browse through the website in the classified ads section and u'll find alot of cars for sale.

This does not justify the higher pay to Westerners. The payment should me made on the work you do. If an Asian worker is doing the same job; in same grade with similar qualification; there is no reason that he should be paid less. Lifestyle Asians have is their choice. Mainly it is because they earn less; not because they like it. An Asian stays in an apartment not because he 'hates' living in a villa in compound. He does so because most of the time he can't afford it. Let's start paying Indians and Pakistanis in Indian and Pak Rupees because cost of living is less in India and Pakistan. One who is being paid QAR20;000 should be paid PKR20;000 because he can live in Pakistan in this pay. He lives in Pakistan; his kids study there; he buys daily grocery from Pakistan and comes to work from there to Doha every morning.

Most people come here to work a while; save money and go back.

Hi QL's..  I assume many of you have been out driving in the dunes..  Me and my family arrived just 3 weks ago; we are now looking for a car.  Which car is the best to do the desert safaris?  is it the Hummer H2 or the LX470 or the BMW X5?  I think also a bigger car is more safe in this traffic; everyone drives likes they are sitting on camels..  :-O Cheers

Although you are seeing big cars here and there but it's not very good; because in many places you cannot enter with your big car. I prefer Hummer-3 ; it's not too big and not too small. it's also nice to drive in the sand. so; think waht you are going to buy!!!!!
Q96_R24_C2 Good
Ultimate off road car is a rental toyota corolla - will go anywhere at any speed. For dunes Landcruiser is king; Nissan Patrol is the next best.   Hummer has leaf springs that are similar to those used on roman chariots. For safety bigger is not better; it might feel like you are in a safer place but chunky offroaders can give a false sense of security. A high 'commanding' driving position might give a better view but in terms of actual safety it is arguable that they offer any greater protection. Qatars best known Pirate - Yaarr!

Thanks for you reply; I am staying in Villa and owner is other person; electricity also on his name who took lease from Arab Guy. that means first party is Arab Person; second party is who gave me on rent; and third or last party is mine... 2nd party is ready to give the contract; but baldiya will attest the contract if yes please advise what are the documents required to get attestation and where is the location.. Thanks in advance.
Q96_R40_C4 Good
tahsinmim; he is asking contract for visit visa not family visa (RP) and the baladiya stamp is not needed; if he is applying for family visa that time baladiya stamp is required and since he is living in a villa then he will need too many papers from all parties. he can get the required documents for the attestation from the baadiya his area belongs to.

Thank you all guys for comments. let me try with contract without attestation and i will come to you.
Q96_R40_C6 Good
according to my knowledge you required an agreement copy even it is a visit visa or permanent visa but for a permanent visa you need lots of documents (You will find it in Baladiya); no offence you can ask from your mandoob he will explain you how it done; I work for a Real-estate company we do all the things for our customers...:)

Traffic fines are in place to serve as punishment for careless drivers. If the police waived or reduced the fines then that would defeat the entire purpose of the system.

Of course you will be fined. Look at the MOI site after a couple of days and check your plate number to confirm it.
Q97_R12_C2 Good
If you STOPPED; the fine will not exceed QR500; if you corrected your position and returned back the fine will not exceed QR300; if you stopped on the yellow lines and remain on that it may reach to QR 1000. Hope you'll get only QR300; Iam not sure about the POINTS.

you may lose 6 points. and fine half.= 3000. be confirm. and careful next time.
Q97_R12_C4 Good
Did you come backwards after stopping the Vehicle the moment you see the RED lights? If you had done so; then there is a possibility where you can convince the officers in Traffic police but you have to visit them & do that. If you fail; then you will earn 7 points & pay QAR 6000 fine
Q97_R12_C5 Good

Q97_R12_C8 Good
Yes you'll be fine for beating the red light amounting 3000 QRs plus additional 7 black points in your license. before the revision of the penalties it was 6000 QRs... Next time be circumspect upon driving specially when passing to a traffic signal bro! Cheers
Q97_R12_C9 Good
if u don't stop the red light the finalty was 6;000. always remember if u see signal light reduce ur speed limit to avoid violation.
Q97_R12_C10 Good
thanks for all answers but I passed the flash machine only; not the lights. you know there is a small distance between the lights and flash machine (radar cam). so; I think it should not be more than 500 QRS; isnt it?

YOUR ARE SAFE DEAR. BEST OF LUCK
Q97_R13_C3 Good
From my personal experience - The Camera will only flash once you Jump the Red Light which means over the zebra crossing. If you happen to cross the zebra crossing in flashing Green or Yellow you will be lucky enough not to get the picture taken. My sister jumped a Clear Red signal at 38 kms per hr speed and she had to 6000QRS and 7 points on the Drivers license. The traffic dept will have a clear video and recording of the incident which you can verfy with. I hope this does not happen to you. Just in case do check this website on timely basis to know of any violations. http://www.moi.gov.qa/site/english/ Good Luck
Q97_R13_C4 Good
Traffic rules 101 - Red means to STOP ... So; If you've crossed the lights while anything but red; you are good. Some people are extra cautious and stop when the green starts to blink (that is just a personal choice) because the fines are just too hefty. But they risk getting rammed from the behind if they brake suddenly. You can pass through even on amber; but it is just not worth taking that risk. Best is to always reduce speed while approaching the lights.

Q97_R19_C8 Good
Don't generalize your own habits to everybody in here. plus if you don't have any idea about a subject just stay quiet. camera flashes when you pass over the sensors which are installed just on pedestrian walkway in front of you. its not necessary to cross the whole signal to get flashed. my case was exactly the same; happened in small signal near apollo polyclinic. i went over the pedestrian walkway by the same mistake and then returned. i believe he didn't cross the signal coz the opposite side traffic was flowing. camera takes two snapshots plus a short video. even if they fine; he can appeal and video is his proof.

Heyyy; I'm back. I found you something in a site that may be better than my own words lol; Sorry I know my English sucks.

Qataris often distinguish themselves from expatriate residents by wearing traditional clothing: the thobe (a floor-length white garment) with a ghutra and egal headdress for the men; and the abayah (a floor-length black robe) with a shayla headdress for the women. In Qatar; the menâ€™s head cloth will be either a solid white or a pattern of red and white. The colors have no religious significance; but may have tribal or cultural significance to the individual wearer. Most Qatari women choose to wear a black headdress; however; a different- or multi-colored scarf may also be worn. Some women wear a full or partial face-veil while in public places in order to maintain personal modesty. Non- Qatari men from selective Middle Eastern and Asian c.....

Hi everyone My husband and I have been enjoing living in Doha for 6 years .Now we have a better job offer in Riadh. We are a moslem Egyptian family; so no problem with the religious atmosphere. But I am worried about how would life be comparing to open Doha; especially for women . sports for kids???places to dine in with the family???parks ???weather conditions???I need help. thanks
Q98_R43_C1 Good
I have heard of punishable restrictions over there.I mean they are very much strict about covering heads and not walking alone without a male member. Although I have heard that no defered quality goods are available over there.They have still low cost of living and good quality of life.But with restrictions...
Q98_R43_C2 Good
Very hot. Very strict. No holding hands. No uncovered head for you. No bars; no clubs. In the restauratn you will be eating behaind the curtains in the family section. You won't be allowed to go shoping without man. And make sure that man is your relative. I would return there only if i would be offered 1 000 000 per month. And no less. Good luck
Q98_R43_C3 Bad
I really appreciate your opinions. I thought the same to myself; but I needed someone else to asure me . But what about sports for kids??I bring my sons to Aspire here; and I enjoy watching them .I guess no similar atmosphere would be available there in Riadh; right ???
Q98_R43_C4 Good
Weather is very dry - no humidity. Not as hot as Doha. winters are colder; but not much. Food / resttaurants offer more variety and much cheaper. Ladies can't drive; but can take taxis. Better choice of schools. Sports are available at the RYSA (Riyadh Youth Sports Association) run by volunteers at the American School. Kids can play Soccer; Basketball and Softball.

where exactly in Riyadh? as Riyadh is too big... if it's in the city...well it's good; the same as doha except for the weather; there's no humid in Riyadh City. But if you are going to live in Riyadh provinces such as wadi dawaser; ha-ir (near riyadh jail) or etc ...you'll find farms and fish ponds :)
Q98_R43_C7 Good
I lived in Riyadh until just recently and I am a western women - you can walk alone; you don't need your husband with u to go shopping - maybe years ago but not now. There are plenty of muslim women out without their husbands. You don;t have to cover your head - unless u already do. Just make sure u carry a scarf as sometimes as women we do get asked to cover up - you will have to wear an abaya though. If u do go out with a man - he must be a relative. You don't have to eat behind curtains in restaurants - that is your choice - but u must eat in the family section. I loved Riyadh and I wld go back tomorrow. Shopping is fabulous compared to Doha - 90% off sales - amazing ; and sooo much variety compared to here. Eating out is so cheap also and loads of variety to choose from. Hope this helps.

Q98_R53
Our company is recently downsizing and unfortunately i'm one of those lucky ones that got terminated. Though our company promised us that they will provide us a release papers . The big question is what will happen to my liabilities in my bank? i have an outstanding loan and credit card.   Thanks in advance guys and hope you can help me.
Q98_R53_C1 Good
If the termination information is given to bank by your company HR department ; The bank will blocked your account ; They will immediately give access once you give them the appointment letter from new company provided that new company is listed in the same bank ; Though your current company is not directly liable for your loan ; If possible request them not to inform bank for the time being and you can continue repay monthly installment to bank in cash or with available balance ; Another option is to withdraw money for your few months expense till you get new Job;
Q98_R53_C2 Good
Once you are terminated than the company transfers all the money to your account they owe to you; like pending salaries; Pending leave salary; End of Service Benefits and cost of unused airtickets; if any. The bank will calculate if this money will close your liabilities. If it does than they will issue a clearance letter; if not than they will not allow you to leave Qatar. You need to look for another job and transfer your sponsership and obtain the same salary transfer undertaking letter from the new company issued in favor of same bank and the things will be normal as before...
Q98_R53_C3 Bad
suppose if company not give you N.O.C than what will happened. where will we go.
Q98_R53_C4 Good
The bank will instruct you to clear all the liabilities no matter how; you cannot leave the country until you clear everything. You need to pay back the money by any means; by selling your assets or by borrowing from ur near and dear ones. but be sure that you have to repay each and every penny that you owe to the bank. In rare cases I came to know that the bank will request the company to grant you release or NOC to find a job and repay the amount.....but Iam not sure about it

Only one way to find out Franz! Let us know what happens. If its true that you just take a loan and then never pay it back (thanks to the magic of insurance) I'll go to the bank the next day and take a loan for a new Mercedes.
Q98_R53_C8 PotentiallyUseful
don't believe the stupid people who say it's ok to not pay the loan. the insurance does not cover termination. when you applied for a loan; there normally is a clause in your salary letter (depending on where you're employed) saying that it is your employer's responsibility to inform the bank that you are leaving their services and/or your final dues will be paid to your bank account with them. you may need a clearance letter from the bank before you are able to leave qatar permanently. you may be able to get away with a simple exit permit but you might become blacklisted and might never be given a visa to enter qatar or even the gcc again. also; they might have ways to find and go after you; you never know.

Franz ..... You are no longer getting any pay ... so you won't be returning anybody's borrowed money ... Everybody understands it . You were already paying a premium towards the insurance of your loan ..... so bank officials will recover it from the insurer ... but normally bank officials and insurer get together to force you illegally to cough out some amount by frightening you with the names like police & airport etc ..... that's their style .... you show them your style .... be bold to tell the truth that you wish to leave quickly .... Your duty is to worry about your next job not the insurer 's lost money . It is insurer of your loan who has to deposit your balance loan money .... they make huge profits ...only on few occasions they are paying it back ... that's why they cry. We are with you .... at this difficult time & Wish you good luck ... Wed; 05.03.2014 ; 06.43 hrs ....

"DPS seems to be a stable school presently although the campus is nothing great . They are having teachers shortage and websites have their ads . DMIS have a great campus with many teachers from north india ; so your child will NOT end up saying "" TWENDY or AUNDY "" -so no accent issues . DMIS is varkey group with high fee structure .

Q100_R46_C6 Good
Ricky ur right We visited Bhavans in Wakra for the admission of my son to std1 and the welcome was not good. All the housewives ( teachers ) talked very rude and seems they dont care for new enquiries.We wanted to see the school but was turned back by a MADAM saying ' Parents are not allowed to see the class rooms'. It was on saturday morning and not on any working days. No coordinators found to discuss any topic.Even the Transport incharge escaped our queries by saying ' I will cal u back in 10mins' and that cal never happened so far. Finally after having to wait in the reception with my wife for some time; a lady adviced us to come on some other day and try..FANTASTIC isn't.....This was my recent experience with Bhavans.We went there keeping in mind ;How Bhavans schools in India are managed. I think Bhavans Doha needs to improve a lot.
Q100_R46_C7 Good
Hello crschrls08; I think there are teachers from Bhavans India at Bhavans Wakra. The reception at Bhavans had been cordial to us. My child is studying there and he is happy. My comment is that one must make the decision based on location advantages only since I think no school is perfect in all aspects.
Q100_R46_C8 Good
Its very strange to see your remarks as my child is also studying in Bhavans and I'm more then satisfied. Saturday is a holiday and only necessary staff and house teachers are there who are not local or House Wife's as stated by you instead they are teachers on school sponsorship. Even if you meet a local teacher; they are so caring and you will appreciate and will definitely praise them for there approach; caring; giving attitude and knowledge. For your information seeing classrooms or going to the classrooms are not even allowed in India and is a policy. There is always a coordinator available at the reception and she is well equipped with all the necessary information. I even didn't understand why you need to see the transport in charge as what you need to see was the coordinator. In fact when we had gone for admission for our child it was like everyone there was to welcome us. The way they greet you and give you regard is beyond comparison. I believe you have some sort of b yest fe.....

Q101_R46_C5 Good
Is it possible for you to mention in what field you want to try your luck here. You see; someone may be able to guide you where to apply there. Coming over here trying your luck with a visit or business visa entails some risks; whereas if you get a job thru an agency will be much better. Visit or business visa has a limited duration and perhaps the present situation is not too conducive for such a plan. I suggest you check the POEA website for jobs available here in Qatar. And if you've applied; just keep on posting here; so that we; your countrymen; or some kind soul here in QL can guide and help you in your job search. At least we can tell you if the company you're applying in is good. Btw; Qatar has committed a lot of jobs to PGMA when she was here. That would be a good start for you to think and just apply there. Well; this is just my suggestion; and it's still your final decision on which route to take. Good luck and God bless you! :)

Go for a pair of arnettes. They're similar to Oakley's in that they are a surf/snowboard type brand. They have a good range of designs and styles and are generally pretty decent value. As has been mentioned you can get a 30% discount with an Asian Games Volunteer card but I suspect most of the sunglass shops in Doha would discount by about that much anyway with the usual haggling. BTW; I had a pair of Oakley's a few years back and the arms kept snapping. They got fixed no problem but it's no fun to have to go for a few weeks without sunnies while they get fixed. I suspect that it would take longer to get them fixed in Qatar as well. A few of my friends have had similar problems and as a result I won't buy them again.

Hi QatarKiwi; Welcome to Doha. Hope you are settling in. As far as quality acoustic guitars here in Doha; there is basically nothing to speak of. Modern home has a very basic Yamaha (although I had heard they were going to expand); but the Souq selection is woeful. Al Badie is quite good for gear and amps; some string; but nothing really for acoustic. (Phone number is 442-3554; give them a call if you like) If you are going to Dubai; check out Zak's Electronics near the Post Office in Karama or some of the shop at Fish Roundabout (taxi's will know these places) Strings are cheaper there than here in Doha and much more selection. Zak's is primarily electric (Fender; Ibanez so on) but they have some nice Fender; Yamaha and Guild acoustic guitars too. I haven't found Takamine anywhere out here; but depending on the airline; most will take a guitar as extra for minor fee. Better to strum your Takimine out here for whatever that fee is; than to pay over the top for a substandard no-name you.....

So the sooner you take steps to prevent crow's-feet; the younger the skin around your eyes will look. If the damage is already done; there are ways to minimize their appearance.

Glycolic acid encourages wrinkled cells to slough off and newer ones to emerge. The moisturizing agents in the cream will prevent any wrinkling from dryness. Not many over-the-counter eye creams contain glycolic acid; says Dr. Weiss. One is Murasome Eye Complex 10 by Murad (developed by a dermatologi.....

Lou; it depends on what dents problem u have. Dentist are also like medical doctors. They have their especialization. Would u mind to mention ur dental problem? (e.i. filling? extraction? ortho? & etc) So members on this forum could recommend u to the right dentist. Dr. Marwan Kalla is a very good in Orthodontist; I highly recommend him. For dental surgery; Dr. Hassan is one of the best.

Nazli stated that she had had a filling in that tooth about ten years previously; but she believed that she had not had any root canal treatment on that tooth.

It's interesting to go out there even if there are no races; as the owners are all exercizing their camels during off days....hundreds of them.

And I caught them; and I also asked a local as to when this all transpired; regularly: FRIDAYS and SATURDAYS AL-SHANAEEHAH (go towards Dukhan; it's on the way; you'll see a signboard that says ""Camel Race"") 1pm-3pm (Definitely starts at 1pm; but may end later) I have only gone Fridays; so I can't vouch for Saturdays.

From what I understand; I cannot live with my boyfriend there. We both have jobs lined up; but we want to wait to marry in another year so our entire family can be with us. Right now; that cannot happen. I do not know what to do. I have read about how difficult it is to find accommodations for a single girl and that I cannot live with my boyfriend. Now I do not know if I should make the move with him.
Q105_R10_C1 Good
Finding accommodation for a single girl is not so difficult. You can definitely find one. If both of you have job offers lined up; I would say why not come here together but live separately till married. Co-habiting of unmarried couple is a big no-no here and may land you and your boyfriend in big trouble with authorities if reported.i.e jail followed by deportation of both of you.
Q105_R10_C2 Good
"Finding accomodation is not difficult. Price is usually the issue depending on what salary you will be making. People do live together but they have to be discreet.

Q105_R13_C8 Good
It is illegal for unmarried couples to co-habit even in hotels. If you were both white European/Westerners; you probably wouldn't be asked. However; your GF is from Asia and she will attract attention simply because a large number of prostitutes in Qatar are of that ethnicity. There is no guarantee you'd be prevented from staying but there's no guarantee you won't Hotels do keep track of who is checking in with who and may even question ladies who are going up to rooms. I have experienced this myself in a 5* hotel where the hotel had a staff member stationed at the elevators. Might you get away with it? Possibly.

1) To date; I have yet to see any sign of academic progression. My child is in KG1; and the only thing that they've seem to have been taught so far is coloring. 2) Unlike other kindergartens where my friends and family's children go to; there are no story telling for the children; no focus on English or Arabic alphabet;and very weak introduction to math.. All and all; very weak emphasis on education. 3) Unlike many professional schools; there are no gym; or phys ed. facilities. 4) Get this; for some odd reason; my child's teacher thought that it would be a great idea to call him by a different contrived name; as way of fun. How is that conducive to a child's development; and self-esteem? 5) I actually got an SMS from the school to tell me that they have 'native canadian english teachers' to teach English.. The trick is; its going to be right after school hours; and for a fee... Makes you wonder; if such skills are readily available; why aren't they part of the school's day staff? 6) Wh.....
Q106_R46_C4 Bad
If your child is in KG1 (in other words 3 years old) then you may be being slightly quick to judge both your child's 'academic' development and also the school's performance in this area. At 3 children should be learning to socialise; become curious; play; make friends; become more self-reliant and independent and have fun! Iqra Preschool helps the children do all of those important things excellently. The school does put greater emphasis on more obviously 'academic' matters when the children turn 4 and enter Reception class but the more subtle 'academic' learning the children get in Nursery class is equally important. Much science is learnt in the sand and water tray in Nursery class even if it does not look like a science lesson to the untrained eye just because it did not take place in a physics lab with reference to a 100 page book. The important question to ask yourself is if your 3 year old child enjoys coming to the school; has made friends; has expanded their vocabulary etc etc.....
Q106_R46_C5 Bad
If the teacher is calling the child with names different than his; than it is a reason for concern and so is a 3 year old child left unsupervised after school hours. I think if any parent notice such negligence from the school part he/she will definately be disturbed. Although I agree with bedawia; that first year in the school is about socialising. The child's fingers are very delicate and nerves are not developed for writing (motor skills are not fully developed). Colouring is for the child to get the knack of holding pencil.
Q106_R46_C6 Bad
If your 3 year old child was attending a school in the UK he/she would be doing the same things described by Badawia (and I presume this is what is taught at Iqra). These are skills that help children think creatively and independently. Both of these skills are essential for higher forms of learning and applying expertise in later life. If a child is simply taught the skill to memorise and regurgitate then he/she will not get far in later life. Unfortunately; too many schools in Doha view this type of structured learning as progress. That is why Qatar is so reliant on expertise from outside.
Q106_R46_C7 Bad
I really appreciate your feedback; and consturctive outlook. What you mentioned resonates quite well with me; however even those 'subtle' learning experiences seem to be absent form Iqra. When I compare my son's academic acumen (i.e. recognition of letters and numbers; phonetics) to other children of his age (from different schools); I can clearly see that he is less knowledgeable than they are. Bear in mind that according Iqra's report cards; my son has consistently scored excellent and above average scores. This begs the question: Are those report cards intentionally being rigged in favor of painting a rosey picture to avoid any confrontation with the parents? Or does Iqra really think that this is the best that a child can do? Neither case sit well with me as a parent. I actually had my son's academic throughput evaluated by a professional educator that is quite versed with UK curriculum and expectations at each level; and she was quite puzzled as to why the report cards tell a diff.....

Q106_R46_C9 Good
I know parents who took their children out of Iqra because they DID NOT get the glowing report they wanted for their child. Iqra reports the truth to parents- not what they want to hear. You should not be comparing your three year old to other children. At this age development in different areas is not exactly the same from child to child. Some will be quicker in areas than your child is but slower than him in other areas. Very few parents leave the school disatisfied and it is a very popular and over subscribed school which is difficult to get a place in. Why don't you ask them to show you the 'academic' curriculum your child will follow in Reception. I think you will be surprised.
Q106_R46_C10 Good
From what I heard; Iqra is actually a very reputable school. I think it's a bit unrealistic to say that your child hasn't learned anything from this past school year and it was all just a waste of time and money. I mean; your child is 3 years old; this is the time for them to learn by playing; singing; socializing; and by being creative...this is what preschool is for! It all might seem a bit unconventional to you because your child might not be learning formal lessons by formal means; but that is reserved for when children are older. In subsequent years; you will see more straightforward academics take a front seat in school. Other than that; you must have been aware of the curriculum and facilities prior to your child going there...right?

So if they let a non-Indian national in; they would be denying another Indian student a seat; that doesn't make sense. By the way; MES is not the only school doing this and neither is this practice restricted to Indian schools. Doha College gives first priority to British. American School of Doha gives first priority to Americans. Qatar Foundation gives first priority to Qataris... So before you call someone 'anarchist'; you really should check your facts first...
Q106_R58_C10 Bad
'anarchist' is not the right word.. verisimilitude's point of view is right..it has always been the prerogative of the schools to give preference to their nationals..
Q107_R7
Hiya; is it possible to find good package holiday deals in Doha? And what locations would be suitable for a restful; quiet beach holiday; not too expensive and lets say 6 hours of travelling max in September/October?
Q107_R7_C1 Good
Thailand! Check out Emirates and Qatar Airways packages. But it's 7 hours to Bangkok. Mandi
Q107_R7_C2 Bad
Well; plus minus 6 hours. 7 isn't so long after all ;) Hmm.. might be a good idea. Just so many places to chose from and so many to avoid if one doesn't want mass tourism; party and girls. What about the rain season?
Q107_R7_C3 Good
Thailand has two coasts and two rainy seasons. If it's dry in Phuket it's raining in Koh Samui and vice versa. If you choose the right resort hotel/location you won't get masses of tourists or the bar girl scene. I really like Thailand (going myself in three weeks) because it's so darn inexpensive. I plan to feast and sleep for next to nothing! My hotels in Bangkok and Siem Reap are about $40/night. I have stayed in the 5-star places (Peninsula; Shangri-la) but I know these little boutique places and they are just fine for my girlfriend from the US and myself. It's a chicks' holiday! And there are the cutest and tastiest Thai restaurants available that I swear have better food than the big hotels. Mandi
Q107_R7_C4 Bad
Hmm.. that sounds like the right holiday for me. Give me a little cabin somewhere. Get out of bed at a certain time; read in the hammock or another cozy place; off to some breadfast; back in the hammock; roll into the sea for snorkeling or swimming; back relaxing; go for a little walk looking at animals or plants; back relaxing... maybe a little half day excursion once in a while but nothing too long; and a simple dinner somewhere in the evening. Perfect relaxing. I definitely don't need a luxurious huge resort. Hmm.. if we decide for Thailand; can I contact you for accommodation advice?
Q107_R7_C5 Good
That sounds like me in Koh Samui! Try tripadvisor.com or fodors.com and read their hotel reviews and their forum on Thailand; kinda like QL! Mandi

Did they think a SALON is for women and since they had seen (Western) films {i.e. cowboy ones) with men going into SALOONS that is the male name equivelant??? and everyone else has followed suit since. Nice man saloon; pretty saloon; and my favourite BOEUTY (something like that) SALOON; the last one would be a good name for a strpiclub cum nightclub.

What I would suggest you is to take your husband back to your country and get it done from doctors ; who deals with ACL surgeries . As per my experience I had got my ACL and meniscus surgery done back in my country ; and its done by a doctor who really specializes in this particular type of surgery .. You got to really reconsider your decision if you are planning to do it in Doha .. My officemate; he got I t done from here in Qatar ; and it was nt a success . If It’s a ACL ; please do some research ; before doing it .. It can be done only once . So my advice please read more about it and don’t do it here in Qatar . Most of the orthopedic surgeons ;will perform the surgery . no doubt ; But a per my research and conversation ; with a lot of medicos; what I have understood ; its little kind of a art; done by some doctors ; who are only trained and specialized in this particular ACL surgery. So Just think over it .. PM me if you want some Details

I still owe them some money. Please advice. Many thanks indeed

Q109_R20_C7 Bad
Really thanks for you interaction with the subject. I was brought here with another company and I worked for it one year and some few months before I found this new company that i want to resign from; I transferred my sponsorship to it. some of you ask me how come they owe me money and I have not signed the contract yet; the answer is that they give me only almost %80 of the salary that we agreed upon at the first time. they promised me that they will compensate me for the other %20. Should I give them one month notice even if we haven't signed a contract yet? Thank you all;
Q109_R20_C8 Good
Usually the longest probationary period is 6 months; but before you started to work in any company you must sign a contract first... and really I don't know how they can transfer your visa under their sponsorship without contract!!! You can leave without prior notice; just submit your resignation; ask them to prepare your exit permit and do not to go to work the following day. But you will not able to get your money in this company. Anyway; they can deny their commitment to you; also in the end they may not give you your final settlement or other compensation! So better talk to your HR Manager/ GM regarding your concern and ask them your status to the company; and at least give you reason why until now there is no contract until this time and when they will provide it. Contract is the only security we have as expats!!!
Q109_R20_C9 Bad
thank you all for your friendly responses. I have not shown any intention that I will resign yet; should I ask them to sign a contract then I will resign so that I can guarantee my rights?. from what I feel I think they want to probate me for 6 moths then they will decide but I do not like all this; it's better for me to go back and relax from all these things.

easy! just tell them i want to go back. cancel me. i just dont like the job neither the country. if they refuse; jump in a karwa and go to the human rights office and explain to them everything; or the easiest way; get ur pans off in the street and within a week u will be back home in ur room relaxin :P

Although you are legally allowed to come back to Qatar and work; you are still required to take a formal NOC from your last employer. If your visa was cancelled by your then employer under normal circumstances; you must not have any problem getting their go ahead nod with a signature and they are obliged to sign your NOC. Only in situations where you made a promise of coming back but did not turn up; you ex-employer might have some dues to settle with you for example; that you might have a problem.

"congrats for the new job ^^ .. i have experience in this kind of stuff and i would tell you that it has nothing to do with your age .. The part about the ""Criminal Dept"" and the immigration stuff you need 2 things .. the first is luck and the second is you make sure that the salary that is writen in the paper and the job title is not too high because that would take about 25% from your chance anless its a job special that Qatari's dose not like or its a privet company because that's almost 95% sure that they will accept . So if it's a normal job and the salary is under 7000 (if you can ask them to change it so they would only write the basic and write ""Full salary"" that would be a big help) then you just take it and do the medical and the finger printing and ask god for him ^_^ . i hope you get accepted .. good luck !"

Q110_R9_C10 Bad
"dear; it is in the human nature to like solid and tangible proofs; as curiousity and doubt are most likely to infiltrate the human soul and mind. See for example the following verse which speaks about the father of prophets - Abraham- who; though a strong believer; asked his Lord for a tangible proof for His Abilities for his heart to be fully assured. ""And (remember) when Ibrahim (Abraham) said; ""My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead."" He (Allah) said: ""Do you not believe?"" He [Ibrahim (Abraham)] said: ""Yes (I believe); but to be stronger in Faith."" He said: ""Take four birds; then cause them to incline towards you (then slaughter them; cut them into pieces); and then put a portion of them on every hill; and call them; they will come to you in haste. And know that Allah is All-Mighty; All-Wise."" [Quran 2:260]"
Q110_R12
This is a question to the likes of PM and others who converted to Islam. Basically; what is involved ? How does a person start the process ? Just intrested....
Q110_R12_C1 Good
My start was that I went to the department of Islamic Affairs and got a bunch of books including the Quran. I started reading at 11am and did not stop until 11pm. I immediately knew that this was the religion for me; eventhough I was highly sceptical when I started reading.... I have read so much since; learned by talking to other Moslims; taken some courses; but my thing is reading so I did that the most. I suggest you talk to some other new moslims. It will be easier as the questions you have are the same questions they had. When I started there were not many people I could approach; nor where there any centres as such and I talked with moslims by birth and they had a hard time understanding my questions. Ofcourse if I can help; let me know! Aisha-Taweela

Q110_R12_C4 Good
It is not a question of easy or not. Converting to Islam is not just saying; Hey world I think I will become a moslim. No it is much much deeper. It is a question of a total change in lifestyle (in my case at least) It has more to do with your innerself. How you look; approach and accept what is in your life. I can tell you it did better than going to a phychoanalist. You learn so much about your self; about the purpose of you being there; about the purpose of living; about the purpose of hardship. Islam should not be hard on you. But it is how hard you make it on yourself. Aisha-Taweela

Q110_R20_C5 Bad
Kind of proves my point..... Get them while they are young and we can brain wash them for life..... So surely the answer should be to have religious studies so that they can learn about all the world's religions and then they can make an informed choice of which one to follow. Otherwise your religion is based on chance. The fact that you were born to patents of that religion. It'd be a real bummer if your parents happen to follow the wrong god...

It's really up to the individual...imho; she could have extended the leotard down to the knee and covered her head with the same outfit material to be a little more covered.

"As far as I know FIG has certain rules with respect to leotards; and some years ago French team was fined for having their leotards too open. Same rules won't allow to use the outfit covering the whole body. Actually this Qatari gymnast does already have a special leotard with ""shorts"". The question remains - if she is doing something against islamic rules (and she does); how come she represents an islamic country? Don't you see there a contradiction? Will she be ostracized by let's say her schoolmates for showing her body in the public? Since religion and tradition are so interwaved in the Middle East I am just trying to understand where the personal preference ends and religious law begins."
Q110_R43_C10 Good
She would not be ostracised by anybody. It's really up to her and what she chooses to wear. I guess she believes that in the end she answers to Allah. Some say religious advice on clothing is law; some say guidelines. I think her family/husband have agreed with this choice of outfit; as has the Qatar team she represents. Not a big deal. Remember; she's wearing it in a sporting competition; not down the local souq. In all religions; the followers practise their belief in lots of different ways. For example; here in Qatar one sees Muslimas completely covered in black...face covered; black gloves on; the lot. Then you see other Muslimas in very figure-hugging outfits and lots of make up. It'a personal choice. ______________________________________________________________________ Love is the answer...

of course the sunni Muslims are on the right path ; but even the Sunni Muslims have so many different sects in it's self.

Q110_R46_C9 Good
all sects are real muslims (Sunni; Wahab ; Shia or etc). becuase all has same Basic belief. (For e.g one God; Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) ; Same salat; fastings; day of judgment and etc). they are divided due to different interpretations. Some interpretations are extremly wrong which made very very wide difference. But such type dirrences are not more then 5%. Beleif of ALi; Hassan or hussain doesn't mean that it is shirk unless someone treat them same as Allah. and Shia's not treating them same as Allah. So It is wrong perception. Ali is friend and son-in-law of Our Prophet (PBUH) and Hassan and Hussain are grand-sons (Sons of Ali) of Our Prophet (PBUH). Therefore; they are beloved to our Pophet and we should respect them. I am not shia but i believes that they are also muslims like all other sects.

Halaqas are when people get together to disucss religion; learn new things together; etc. Tahfeeth is the arabic word pertaining to memorizing the mushaf. Hope that clarifies those words for you.

thankyou faz :-) but you mentioned another new word now; mushaf. what does it mean?is it passages of the quran. are you looking for halaqa in arabic or someone who can help with english as well.most mosques would have it in arabic; i would presume. happy heart drive safe because someone is waiting for you at home

it depends on your aims. for understanding the whole grammar and be able to talk in the streets and for a basic understanding of what you've read you will need a whole year with 2 - 3 hours daily along with a lot of exercises at home. if you are a beginner i would suggest that you join the arabic classes in fanar building close to corniche. they have four levels. these levels will be enough for you as a beginner.

English is not an easy language - but Arabic is much more difficult . Once I read from an expert that learning Arabic needs ten times more time and effort than learning English for example . The big problem is not the letters - they are easy to learn - but the words ... There are so many dialects that you have to choose one dialect first of all . Or if you choose the standard Arabic then you will understand speakers of news channels or religious teachers - but you will not be able to communicate or they will just laugh at you .... Sometimes it seems to me that there is not such thing that Arabic language . There are dialects which are similar to each other like French is similar to Italian or to Spanish .

but shapil you speak english so the french vocab isn't that alien arabic its all different so i do think vocab is a great place to start.... but its difficult because a. huge varieties of arabic spoken here b. you go shopping and a lot of people are not arabic speakers and then OP can go for a walk with one of the friendsheeps.... and wish they hadn't bothered trying!

am i going to compar Doha with Jeddah yea talk about Riyadh then we can talk like Alexa who was once upon a time resident of Riyadh and is dreaming of having a dream house in Riyad :D in life style freedom Doha is alt more better than Jeddah i have been to Jeddah about 8 times in 8 years its all the same yea few construction might have taken place but i think you will live with ppl and drive on road so
Q113_R15_C2 Good
I loved Riyadh. Great social life. Jeddah is nice too. A strange mix of old and new. Amazing diversity. Much cheaper than Doha. If you are Muslim; than what more can you ask for than having Makkah and Medina within easy reach. Jeddah is also closer to Jordan. However; Qatar is a lot more open and freer; but I find it more boring. You can travel out as and when you want. It si very peaceful and people can visit you more easily. The choice is yours..
Q113_R15_C3 Bad
thank you both! BritExpat - why do you think doha is more boring?
Q113_R15_C4 Good
Doha is much smaller. Less of everything. Rstaurants are expensive. One other thing is that Qataris are far more easy going than Saudis.

Q113_R15_C7 Good
Jeddah without a doubt! Qatar is all hype and no substance. Besides in Jeddah you have access to the sea where as here you go to the corniche and just look at it...I wouldn't be surprised if they start taxing for that soon.

so Jeddah is actually more fun than Doha?? I really thought it would be Doha bc they do have clubs and bars and potential concerts - all which arent allowed (or in the open in Saudi)...

Doha is better than Saudi; as women do not have dress restrictions; you can buy liquor; there are parties; and religous workships for other religions. So its more liberal than Saudi.

I'm looking for the closest IKEA Store.. has anyone had any experience with them? I'd like to purchase it and have it shipped here in Doha but I cant seem to find a site where I can purchase it online. Is it practical to have it shipped from the UAE or Saudi? Please let me know; I appreciate it.
Q113_R23_C1 Good
You have to go to Dubai and buy it in the store - and then get it driven overhere buy a truck... It's quite a hazzle - but it's depending on how much you will buy if it's worth it - I took the blue pill and found myself alive in Qatar - wish I had taken the red and stayed in Europe
Q113_R23_C2 Bad
you know lost...one thing you might consider is this...get together with others; have them give you cash for the their purchases...and that should get your order up to enough to make it worthwhile to ship over...just a thought.

I like their style and so do many of my friends - the nearest one is in Dubai going by plane of course. The goods can come by ship to Doha which is less expencive than plane and come quite quickly.

Q113_R35_C5 PotentiallyUseful
Indeed; no Ikea in Qatar... but one will certainly open witin the next years. If you REALLY want Ikea furniture; indeed; the best is to buy it from Dubai (email adress given before)... with the risk to find damage stuffs; and how to prove how's mistake?? But of course; everything can also arrive in a very good shape with an external shipping company (quid about the cost?) Second solution; you forget Ikea (at least for 2 years); and yes; I think also it's better to buy here. I will add Home Center stores (one in City Center; one near Jeidah Bridge). All my furniture is coming from there and since 2 years I have noticed no problem. Follow The White Rabbit

I simply went to Abu Dhabi; loaded my car (a 4x4 Ford Explorer) with boxes from IKEA (actually you can fit in a lot!) and took it to Qatar.

Symptoms of avian influenza in humans have ranged from typical human influenza-like symptoms (e.g.; fever; cough; sore throat; and muscle aches) to eye infections; pneumonia; severe respiratory diseases (such as acute respiratory distress); and other severe and life-threatening complications. The symptoms of avian influenza may depend on which virus caused the infection. In general; H5N1 remains a very rare disease in people. The H5N1 virus does not infect humans easily; and if a person is infected; it is very difficult for the virus to spread to another person. While there has been some human-to-human spread of H5N1; it has been limited; inefficient and unsustained.

Q113_R49_C3 Good
Don't wait a single minute also in Qatar. Go to KSA. With 3850 SR. you will find a big apartment including 2 bedroom & can maintain your food expenses. I was in Jeddah before for 1.5 years in 2005-2007. I used to live in a house which was SR. 1800 per month & I found same category house in Qatar is more than 6000 QR. Everything is cheap there even car. Example: Hoda Accord 2009 (2.4ltr) in Qatar is 104;000 QR. In Saudi it's 85;000 SR. and in Bahrain it's 76;00 BHD (76;000 QR.) I think your housing allownac is enough for your food expenses & to pay house rent. No need to touch your basic. So; take your decision now.
Q113_R49_C4 Good
its up to you whether you're getting below QRS 3000 or more than if you're a type of person like one day millioner then nothing right so whether in qatar or saudi just knw your limits then you'll be fine.

Q114_R28
A continuation from the ""staring "" thread..... Do certain men treat women in a disrespectful way(as perceived by women) because if and when they see a woman without man; or a Western woman(even with her husband); they stare and are rude....is this because of culture and how they are taught to look at ""such"" women? Or is is because the gender ratio is skewered here?"
Q114_R28_C1 Good
I am western and have never had anyone say anything rude to me but they do stare. I think you are reading far too much into this. As many have said; a lot of these guys have been years without seeing a decent woman. As long as they are not saying anything (sorry you had that happen) no one has ever died from being stared at. I feel sorry for these guys more than anything; pity they have no manners and to be honest a lot of them don`t even realize they are doing anything wrong.
Q114_R28_C2 Good
so true; they stare like they haven't seen a human being before! in a crowd some man find ways to rub a lady shoulder or any skin part. we ex-pats here must understand that they are not use of seeing women skin coz usually women here are all over covered. so its up us now to take care of ourselves or understand the way they think. cheers

Q114_R28_C5 Bad
How tactless - no black person ever died from being called the 'n' word - doesn't make it right.
Q114_R28_C6 Good
Oryx; different context. These guys come from a culture where it is OK to stare; we do not. That doesnt mean that we always expect everyone to bend to what makes us comfortable; and do realize that sometimes there is more to what you deems as ignorant staring than there really is. Appreciate the tactless comment though; I can see you gave the whole idea a great deal of thought.
Q114_R28_C7 Good
if we understand that they are like that; we are more aware that we should take good care of ourselves. we should try to avoid being harass; but ofcourse their stares and look is not in our control. if they physically and verbally harass CALL THE POLICE. cheers
Q114_R28_C8 Good
Stares are not classified as harrassment here so calling the police is useless. I don`t agree that it depends on what a woman is wearing here; they will stare regardless.

Q115_R7
Good evening to everybody; we are moving to Doha in April and I am staying at home with our daughter of 17 months. I was wondering if you can tell me how is life with a toddler in such a hot country? Here she likes outdoors so much; I cannot imagine how it is done in such a heat. What do you mums do all day to keep them occupied? Is it better to leave to Europe in the summer?Thanks so much
Q115_R7_C1 Good
Hi; I have 3 children and they love the outdoors but during the summer months I send them out only after sunset because it's really hot and we have a lot of sand storms or dust storms so then it's either malls or playing indoors at friends homes. There are a few mother and toddler groups that do fun activities so you could join them. July and August are school holidays here so many go on vacations. Ramadan is also around this time so no eating or drinking outside and shops open late too. Best of luck with your move.
Q115_R7_C2 Good
most westerners escape summer heat especially july-august. I know several families where the wife leaves for Europe as of mid-june until end of Aug. You have to be creative to keep them busy since Doha offers very little to keep kids busy (unless you want spend 3-4 hours in a mall each day).
Q115_R7_C3 Good
"Us ""mums""; A.K.A. stay-at-home-dads; get together with other mums and dads; and have outings to the zoo; park; beach; water front; park; park and park. It's only hot for a few months; so plenty of chances to get out and about with out the kids melting. Plenty of classes such as music classes; gymnastics (for toddlers); playgroups and other things. We have found Doha very much geared toward families with children. Whilst we hear our single friends complain about Doha being too boring; people like us can only dream of the days when we could sleep in for two days if we felt like it. Don't worry; Doha is a very family-friendly place with many activities inside and out; for children. Cheers"

Hi; My husband getting job offer at Doha Qatar and we are moving from USA to Doha in September; based on what we read on the site it seems like Doha is not safe anymore. I am little nervous since i have to be at home all the time; taking care of two kids. As per my husband offer we will get 4-5BHK compound villa. Is it safe to be in compound Villa? Also; how is the social life at Doha especially; evening...as we here in USA; as a female I could go anytime with my infant for grocery or mall shopping but how is it in Doha? Also; i saw that everyone said drive carefully. Any help greatly appreciated. Thank You;
Q115_R7_C8 PotentiallyUseful
Hi Papu21; Doha is quite a safe city. When we shifted from UK to Doha; we already knew that this place is generally very safe for families. To answer your question; yes a compound villa should be plenty safe. Crime is very very low in Qatar. We have fire extinguishers & smoke alarms in our rented villa; if you are worried about fires. Re health; we had a good experience with the general children's hospital when our child was sick. Lots of concerned doctors; all tests done to ensure nothing was missed and lots of consultations with other doctors to ensure proper medication and treatment was given. Most social activities happen in the evenings when weather is cooler. You can go shopping anywhere and anytime the shops are open; on your own or with your child; in tshirts/shortsleeve blouses and jeans/skirt. No need for head/face coverings or your husband by your side. This is quite common for locals and expats here. Re driving; I find that there is hardly any road courtesy; lots of big car.....

Hv a look at fun city on the top floor of centre point ... i like that place since it is clean. Others is the top floor of The Mall ; where the play area is ... they also do party for kids there with soft plays.

Sorry; but 3 of my friends really doesn't like and had bad experience with koala. Two of them are parents and feel something not true and saw incoherence. One of them worked there and told us the worst things we could hear. What better we can know from a worker; a person who can see more than parents ! Actually; she told me lot of exemple that what they show to the parents is completely different than what's really happen there. So for that I really do not recommend this nursery !

my son's been in koala nursery for the last 6 months. hes improved a lot in his talking and in his behavior; in his eating habits. he already knows the alphabets; numbers from 1 to 10 and many nursery rhymes. i am really happy with the nursery and especially with his teachers and the teaching assistants. i always feel he is safe over there. i have visited many nurseries before sending him to koala. and i feel koala is the best. the director is a wonderful lady and shes very pleasant and always caring about the kids. never ever had a bad experience with them.

Q116_R7_C1 Good
you can have a public health insurance in doha for 200QR.... if you are looking for higher health coverage; you will be talking about 1500-3000QR a year (private hospitals) anyways; health services are available for quite affordable prices in doha; I have been living here for 3 years now; thank god; I have not needed any serious medication; but as I hear from the guys it is not that expensive (considering that doha is TAX FREE country) if you are looking for teeth insurance... (in can range from 150-250 riyals per tooth for normal teeth rust fixing); but if it is a surgery... then it is 500 riyals and above per tooth.  dont worry about it.... it is steaming hot here and you will like it :P

I am from England and i think we have a similar National Health system there than Australia so I think I know where you are coming from.  I was also a nurse back home so I have formed my opinions of the health service here based on this.  Qatar has a NHS that is available to all residents once you have paid 100QR for a health card that gives you a patient number. This entitles you to emergency treatment; routine referrals; surgery etc. It is not free at the point of delivery but an outpatient appointment is 50QR for the first appointment then 30QR each visit. Overnight stays depend on the type of ward you choose; single room; semi private (2 beds) or ward (4 beds).  I had an op here and was in a 4 bed ward and it was fine; cost 100QR for 2 nights.  The health service is based on the American model and is regulated by a Canadian company as far as I know so all issues with culture; confidentiality; patient rights are similar to the experience I had in the UK.  Thee are 2 private hos.....

They told me that they sent my passport to the Qatar Embassy for Visa Stamping. After 1 week they called me and told me that my passport with the visa stamp is already in POEA for OEC. Today (Oct. 9; 2012) they called me and asking me to go to their office for the PDOS. Tom. (Oct. 10; 2012) will be my PDOS.

Since you cannot get QAR. you have no choice other than USD

No need to worry. Bring whatever currency you have with you. There are hundreds of money exchanges here in Qatar; you can change your money. Even on the airport; there is currency exchange where you can change some of the money; but I know their rates are little lower than the normal market; so better to change your more money in the other exchanges here in Doha.

Dollar works just fine and you get a standard rate out here and it should make your life that much easier rather then carrying other currencies

Yes - You have to find ways to earn money bcoz you need money to live. Happiness will come once you fulfill all your living needs which will never happen.

Acquire. Do not DISPENSE - You have to be comfortable looking at the poor as people to be exploited and not people to be helped.

You need an affidavit of support. It's one of the requirements. That is to prove that somebody will support their stay here in Qatar.
Q119_R74_C2 Good
Yes; you have to take a letter from Phil.embassy qatar since your son is traveling with somebody else. Better include your RP and other supporting documents for your son and sister-inlaw free from hassle during their travel.
Q119_R74_C3 Good
Affidavit of support is required. But sometimes NAIA immigration officer are not asking it. Just to be sure; send the original copy with stamp of Phil. Embassy-Qatar. If you have flat/house contract give them a copy as another proof.

"""1 Litre is an eleven episode drama that aired in the Fall of 2006. It is based on the true story of Ikeuchi Aya. The series begins with Aya; a happy and athletic high school student. It is discovered that she has Spinocerebellar Degeneration; a degenerative and fatal disease. At first; Aya's parents decide it would be best to keep her illness from her; but Aya begins to suspect something is wrong with her. This series shows us Aya's amazing strength as she struggles to come to terms with and then live with her disease. In the process she touches the life of those around her and of people throught the world who are inspired by her courage and determination to continue to live on; even in the most difficult of circumstances. I was drawn into 1 Litre from the first episode. To say it will have you crying would be an understatment. However; the sadness of the series should not keep anyone from watching it.

it depends. if you can clear the entrance test with good rank. then you don't pay anything any extra. you will get in merit category. the other option is to get in management quota. where days they charge you higher fee per year as compared to merit student.

I have read several newspaper reports about peral qatar and how its thrown open for expats to invest in this project. With land prices and rentals shooting up in Doha; I felt it would be better to invest in Pearl Qatar and this would only be an appreciating asset...

Q121_R20_C2 Good
From what i've read about it; it is considered to be a good investment and definetly the prices will go up; expected around 20% at least within next few years. As for the completion date; i wouldn't worry to much about the delays cause the first towers that were supposed to be there by dec 2007 -will be there. I know a person who bought an apartmant in those first towers. unless something really bad and unexpected happens ; there shouldn't be any worry about your investment in the Pearl.

I later told this story to some of my US friends over here; and almost everyone of them laughed at me; saying the same thing happened to them. One of the big secrets the Embassy won't tell you is; if a foreigner wants to apply for a travel visa to the USA; he or she HAS to apply in the country they have a passport for.

what is the procedure for lost baggage in air arabia; the air arabia representatives (ragency travels) they said there will be a compensation i.e. 20 $ per killo. who knows th etrue situation? as far as I concern our baggage worth more than 200$; and it is very unfare to just pay for the weight of the bag.
Q122_R48_C1 Good
I know it is unfair but as far as I know that isn't air arabias rules... they are the international rules under the Geneva convention or something. All airlines abide by these international rules. If you want to claim more money you have to do it through your travel insurance.

Not living in Doha at the moment; but I wondered if travelling on vacation is expensive from Doha and whether holiday packages are common? I had a quick look on the Doha's Regency Travel and Tours website and the choice of packages shown online is extremely limited. Is this representative; or are there lots of travel agents on the high streets that can arrange regular holiday packages at a reasonable price? Many thanks; Sarah

Sadly there is only one short answer...NO. And there is no Highstreet either.

Q122_R76
i just got my loan 6 months ago and i been terminated by the company.What will be the procedures with the bank regarding my loan?my company is not giving release?is there any chance that my company will release me to continue paying my loan?Is there an insurance for all personal loans?if there is how long it will take to get the clearance from the bank?please advised.
Q122_R76_C1 Good
There is insurance but it applies on death only. So you have to find a job. If the company where you find already is in approved list; no need to worry. Just present the offer letter & a letter from the company ( new) that your visa is under process. On receipt of letter; please approach your branch. If you don't find a suitable job & want travel ban so that you can find a suitable job; please make sure that you give guarantee cheques against your loan to bank so they will do the rest. If you already given cheque & needs a clearance letter without payment of money; you need a good guarantor!!!

thanks Gonsalves85.meaning there is chance that my company will still relase me if they don't give before?are you sure that insurance is only for death?not include the termination from work?So there is no chance for me to go out of qatar if there is no insurance.because somebody told me that termination from work is included in the insurance.
Q122_R76_C3 PotentiallyUseful
Are you looking for the insurance after termination? Insurance will not cover job loss.
Q122_R76_C4 PotentiallyUseful
if not cover so there is no chance for me to go out qatar.the best way is to negotiate to my employer to give release so that i can work again and continue paying to the bank.Like this do i have a better chance to get release from my company even they told me that they will not give release>
Q122_R76_C5 Good
making any kind of loan in the bank; they said to be your assurance that you will not be deported here in the country. it is now a common tactics by the employees to loan in the bank for personal interests; they want to work or let us say to be stable here in qatar for a long time. your company will have no choice but to release you that if you have in good terms with your company. in my two cents; in your case that your employer is not willing to give you a NOC; there is something misunderstanding or dispute going on with you and your employer. and that's a different story now if in that case. we are invisibly handcuffed by our sponsor here for all we knew. we cannot easily do what we want to do here. so go on to the flow with the system of your company. all of this is just my two cents. good luck bro. http://qatarliving.com/node/6201601
Q122_R76_C6 PotentiallyUseful
thnx nikon im not telling we are not in good terms with my employer.is there no chance for the court to give them order to give me NOC to work in other company so i can continue paying the bank.im just hoping that they will give me NOC because there is compny willing to hire me already im just not sure to get an NOC.im just thinking what if they will not give me an NOC and i cant go out qatar how i will leave here in doha.Im willing to pay and work.is there any other way.
Q122_R76_C7 PotentiallyUseful
Patience there's no guarantee that your company will give you NOC. It is their sole discretion. Only you can try and explain your situation. I don't think there is an insurance to cover job loss. My own friend was jailed for non-payment of his bank loan. But lucky for him he got NOC and found another low paying job to continue to pay his obligations.
Q122_R76_C8 PotentiallyUseful
tnx alexam.i need to go to the bank and negotiate and bring my termination letter and listen what i need to do.if there is really no insurance for lost jobs then i should put my attention on getting NOC.thanks for all the advised guys
Q122_R76_C9 PotentiallyUseful
Well it is not your work out here that matters but how you go about your other things; taking a big loan for example is an insurance in itself that the sponsor cannot cancel your visa and kick you out. If your current sponsor is not going to give you a NOC then just let the bank and your sponsor settle the matter between themselves. The higher the loan the more interesting is the situation
Q122_R76_C10 Bad
tnx good old joe.somebody told me that also one of my mandub friend.Taking loan is giving me assurance that can be be release from my previous company.My RP is just renew for 1 year more.If my company will not give NOC what they will do to me?still they are the one responsible for me.

OK I was able to get my beloved pitbull Tinky in from the states. How did I do it; well listen up: 1- get a health certificate for travel issued by your vet from back home. 2-get it stamped by department of agriculture; you mail it in and they send it back in about a week if your from the states (must be stateside address) 3- get copies of your dogs vaccination & medical records together along with a copy of the travel health certificate & take it all to the Ministry of Environment over by the airport. 4- at the ministry you will go into a little porta-building outside and they check the documents then fill out the import permit and give it to you right there (30 mins tops) &&&&& IT IS FREE ...take that Qatar pet Relocators 5- now scan the copies into your computer or onto a disc so you can email them to the shipping company of your choice. I suggest KLM Cargo. They have a layover in Amsterdam at KLM's pet hotel staffed with vets and techs to clean the kennel; walk; bathe and feed your.....

that you were able to import a banned breed into Qatar... How did you do that?
Q122_R80_C7 Good
Customs clearance for a dog is normally a 2-4 hour process depending on how busy it is. Day flights are not advised due to how busy the cargo section can get. Use a pet relocator if you want someone else to do the running around and have your pet delivered to you. Ninaridge - some people would rather pay a relocator to do it all for them and give some peace of mind that things are being done properly.

But no way is KL boring ( just ignore blue panther ) I lived and worked there for several years and its a real eye opener.Like the singaporeans the malaysian love their food and you get three major cusines( malay; indian and Chinese ) plus many others.

Food is varied; cheap and easily available throughout the island. Travel via MRT/buses is convienient cheap and they reach most places. Taxis are readily available but are expensive. From airport you can go to city via MRT; bus or taxi. Bus No. 36 goes to the suntec convention center in the heart of the city from the airport basement at T2. Locals speak thickly accentuated english called Singlish. It will take you a bit of time to get the hang of it. It is very safe to even walk around at night though basic precautions should be taken. Bars of different flavors are aplenty. Regarding places to visit...that you can easily find out by doing some search on the internet.

Dears; I'm planning to take kids to the Disney World this summer. They are at the ages I feel most appropriate to enjoy the place. If anyone had been there; please help. Which hotel to choose ( suitable for an infant); what kind of tickets to buy? What are the best attractions? I'm lost. Thanks in advance

Q123_R49_C3 Bad
I'm sorry. Something wrong with my postings. Getting duplicated somehow.
Q123_R49_C4 Good
I'm from Florida about 40 minutes away from Disney and have been there numerous times; I think the issue is your budget; all of the onsite hotels are suitable for children it just depends how much you want to spend. The allstar resorts are the budget one. If you want high end the Disney Board Walk is higher scale; but there are other hotels that are great like animal kingdom lodge. Also the tickets are expensive and they do have multiple day passes that allow you to go to multiple parks per day with a discount depending on how many days you will be there. They also have a meal plan that will save you money.
Q123_R49_C5 Good
"In Florida it means you should be staying in the I4 area or even near Kissimmee. This places should give you a 5-10 mins ride to the parks. Go to booking.com and get some ideas as to hotels; resorts and other accomodations facilities in & out of disney. As for the tickets I would suggest to check your timmings with the timmings of the parks and try to plan a 1day per park; since they are huge and sometimes even 1 day is not enough. There are some tickets named ""value tickets"" which allow you to get entry to say ""3 parks in 3 days; and sometimes you get a little discount. Since I do not know how long would be the trip I would suggest to do a little search on the internet on parks and maybe make a selection so that when you are going to get the tickets the places are already decided and no additional time is wasted on deciding ""to which park should we go today"" (and I had been there; it is not pleasant) Also a travel agent could help you on the tickets for the parks since they sometimes ....."
Q123_R49_C6 PotentiallyUseful
I would stay on the Disney property for the simple fact that you can use the bus system. If you plan on driving you do get free parking to the parks when you stay on Disney Property.
Q123_R49_C7 Bad
Thanks everyone. I have been reading numerous number of reviews on every single hotel in the Disney World. Unfortunately; all of them have some bad comments. Not sure how much I can trust them though. Which attraction do you find the best for kids below 10 years old? We are planning to be there for about 1 week. I will check out the Broad walk inn again. I agree that staying in the Disney World itself is the best. I heard that queues are very long. Thanks again
Q123_R49_C8 Good
Also the park that is most kid friendly is the Magic Kingdom; follow by Animal Kingdom and MGM Studies with Epcot being better for adults and older kids.
Q123_R49_C9 Bad
What do you want to spend per night for hotel?
Q123_R49_C10 Good
If you have kids; suggest you get the multiple day passes. Some hotels offer discounted rates for passes if you stay with them. Why multiple day? One day is not enough to go see all the attractions and with kids usually they get overwhelmed with many people on the first day and they start to enjoy only on the second day. so 3 to four days is good enough. The usual suggestion though is to go first time to the original Disney in Anaheim after that you can go to the other Disney locations. They say there is a certain feeling that you will get when you go to the original Disneyland first. Well... they are right! Enjoy your trip!

jarreau; the best way for you to learn how to wear the shayla (head covering) is to have an arab/qatari friend teach you...because if you observe the women in Doha you'll see that there are many styles and trends appropriate for certain ages; etc. :) i find it intimidating to go shopping for abayas because i don't wear them; and have no idea how to pick a good one out; even though i'm muslim. but if you're willing to try it; then i'm sure nobody would say it's wrong for you to wear one! these things are a very cultural matter rather than religious. so there is probably no 'danger' in offending anyone. :D

Q125_R55_C9 Good
You can wear white cotton underwear; a white hat and a thobe. Make sure that they are ironed & clean. For females; I recommend abayas that are put on the head not on shoulders. You could cover your ears; neck; & all hair.I also recommend that you cover your face if you feel unsafe.

"... but locals are obliged to wear it. I was told at work that they even get an allowance to wear the costume (not sure from the company or the state). They are not supposed to wear anything else while in Qatar. It is sort displaying that you belong to a certain race when you're in a minority situation; and i'm not going into the VIP territory again. As for western women wearing it; as long as you're not walking ""alone""; it should be OK. At the least you should be walking with another woman; preferably wearing the same. If you two get into a Landcruiser at the end of your walk; that's even better :) Moudir"

Q126_R14_C1 Good
all I can say is that;I drove up to and on part of the Corniche ealier today; and yes I saw police and security men stopping people walking to the corniche. It seemed fine to just park up in a car. Noticed most of the people they were stopping were groups of men. Today for many was a well earned rest day; to spend time with family and friends. I can only assume that 'someone' was going to travel on the corniche and 'they' did not want them to see the reality of Qatar - hard workers (I do have to admit it did seem like security were stopping only labour men in their casual clothes) who on a day off wish to do nothing than walk innocently on the corniche with friends.

Your Qatari amnesia? Says it all if your response if yes. So if you’re not married or part of a family you cannot enjoy Eid celebrations on the corniche? The fact that you think this is normal on such a special occasion (something everyone should enjoy regardless of religion; race; marital status) reflects what an uncaring person you are. They were doing the same at the airport the other night where there were huge queues. They would not let Asian workers say goodbye to their families; with police officers actually hitting some people yelling “yalla;yalla.” Qataris were able to say goodbye to their loved ones. Why is that? As well Qataris were jumping the queues; with no one saying a word as they were too scared. Would love to see that happen anywhere else outside the Gulf!! Of course it has to do with being Qatari. You’re telling me that if a single Qatari male walked to the corniche he would have been stopped? Or if a VIP walked; they would have been stopped? Yeah right!! Peo.....

As much as I sympathize with the labours and all; but sometimes their presence is very uncomfortable. Two days ago; I went to the airport to pick up a friend and when I walked in; it was like they've never seen a female before; I just wanted to crawl into a hole and hide; it was VERY uncomfortable having all those men gawk...ekkhhh! So actually I would like a day at the corniche where I could go and not worry about men looking at me like a piece of meat. I remember when they had the fireworks for the 2016 Olympics bid and I was there; and the amount of labours staring as we walked...MY GOD! So I guess the security has the families in their best intentions and I can see why they would stop certain groups from going to the corniche. I'm not always right; but I'm never wrong :P - Garfield

Hi everyone; Very nice to meet you all. :) My wife and I are moving to Doha in about 3 weeks. As I'm going to be working most days; my wife and I are a little concerned about what she'll be able to do to keep her occupied during the day. We were thinking of getting her enrolled at an ESL school (she doesn't speak much English). Besides take courses; what do other non-expat spouses do to keep busy? Thanks everyone. Hope to meet some of you after we arrive!
Q126_R20_C1 Good
Hi! Nice to meet you; hope your move goes well. It can be difficult finding things to occupy your time here; especially when you're new. I'm not sure where you're going to be living? I live in an apartment block with my husband and it has no communal areas so have found it hard to meet and get to know my neighbours. I think compound life is a bit more sociable? Anyway - a couple of ideas... The Intercontinental Hotel (the one near Katara; not Intercont. the City) has a special offer on Tuesdays and Wednesdays - ladies pay only 50 QR to access their pool / pool area. I take yoga classes with Yama Yoga http://yamayogastudios.com - they are lovely and might be another way to meet people? Also; not sure what nationality / language your wife speaks but there are a number of associations for different nationalities here. Buy a copy of Marhaba magazine when you arrive - they have an up to date list of them with contact details - so she could socialise with people who speak her language.

Q126_R45_C6 Good
We take our son to a British nursery so I expect parents who drop off their kids there are Westernized (if they're not expats) and be safety conscious. Then one day; I saw an Arab father strapping his daughter into a BOUNCER that was on the floor of a minivan. I guess he figured that as long as his daughter is secured to something; then that's good enough! ------------- There's a wide variety of carseats here; mostly made by Western companies and the prices are comparable to what you'd pay. I know that Britax convertible car seats are highly rated but I don't think I saw any here. I also wonder; if the carseats weren't so expensive to the locals and other nationalities; will they be more wiling to secure their kids?

The seats are large and there is plenty of room so the children can use them comfortably for a long time.
Q126_R45_C9 Bad
Hi; I'm new to this forum. I feel very passionately about this topic. I have a 19 month old son and am very anal when it comes to car seats. Malaysia (where I come from) does not have car seat laws in place but I still make sure that my son travels in a car seat ; even if it's to the nearby shops. There are many available for purchase in Malaysia but the price is far too expensive for the majority. A decent car seat could set some back two months wages. So I guess even if they are aware of the need for child car seats it is out of their reach and I guess they have other prioritoes like buying food to stay alive and having a roof over thier head. Plus families in Malaysia can have as many as 4 (quite common) up to 14 children. Imagine the logistical nightmare of moving the family members around! .

Q126_R45_C10 Bad
I have never understood the excuse that a person has too many children and cannot afford to put their safety first. I think it's great that people have so many children but please don't have so many if you their safety cannot be a priority. Did anyone hear about that study done in the States about the safety of carseats? ONLY 2 passed!!! That is just unbelievable to me.

Anybody out here doing Triathlon? Can you suggest the best pool around Doha to do Lap swimming? Safest route for biking and running? I just want to get back in shape.
Q126_R46_C1 Good
Seems like we're looking for the same thing around here. I'm pretty new here in Qatar and I've been in search for a lap pool nearby where I can continue my training...or at least keep myself fit. After reading several posts here; seems like those that are easily accessible (for a fee) are hotel pools. As for running; the only route I've tried so far is at the Corniche. I usually start near the Sheraton hotel and go the opposite end then back. Biking on the other hand...haven't tried yet as I didn't bring my bike here. My friends advised me not to since it's not a safe place to bike - due to the hot weather and also crazy drivers on the road. Although I'm still planning to buy a bike eventually and look for a long stretch of road outside the city where one can go cover several kms during the cold season.
Q126_R46_C2 Bad
do you guys know where to find road bike shops here in doha? not to mention mechanics and parts... i have a regular beach swim site but i get to be active only when the weather cools down... soon it will come. sad to say my fitness level is at the lowest now. i think my swim place is safe enough for road bike laps during early weekend mornings... i really love to push ahead with brick works; let say swim/bike or swim/run... do you guys want to start from scratch as a tri-group??
Q126_R46_C3 Bad
"I am a hard core triathlete - and considering moving to Doha - I train about 20 hours per week - I've trained in Vegas during the summer; and while the heat isn't ideal; it is doable. I also train in New York City; and while the traffic and cars are not great - I've survived so far. What I need is a stretch of road that is at least wide; if not quiet. I need to ride between 80 and 120 miles on the weekends. A loop of 40 miles that I can do 3 times would work - but I need a decent shoulder or a place that isn't too busy - Is there such a thing as a ""country road"" near Doha? Is swimming in the ocean permitted? Can women swim too? Are there any lap pools? Maybe at the universities? When I train I usually wear the typical tri-outfit - is this going to be a problem? What about for women trainers?"

You don't need to exit. Just get an NOC from the sponsor that got you the business visa along with the new one to Immigration Dept at Gharaffa. I believe you need to fill a form (not sure now). Your new employer will pay to transfer sponsorship. Just ask your mandoob or your new employer for details. But I'm sure you do not need to exit the country before being issued an RP for sure.

canceled rp u leave in a week and cant come back for 2 years (assuming no NOC )and if I let it run out (not giving my ex employer my passport)I have to leave 2 months after the RP expires )but sponsor cant give me exit permit . so confusing ....
Q127_R76_C8 Good
Only a small correction here... Even if you run out your RP and will leave after 2 months from its expiration date; you still need an exit permit from your sponsor to leave the country. UNLESS... like i said; if they reported you to the authority as absconding or run away from sponsor. Then your sponsor is no longer responsible for you but the authority; and the authority will look for you and deport you without the need of exit permit.

Where I get a multiple exit permit?? My sponsor gave me a single exit form for travelling and I heard bak in Qatar in the airport that I can go with that permit also to a special office in Doha to arrange a multiple exit. Who can help me.. where i can go? Is it (still) working?? or the laws changed?? I heard that too....... Merci
Q127_R78_C1 Good
it costs QAR 500 and valid for a year. But that is the prerogative of your employer/sponsor.
Q127_R78_C2 Bad
its not free?? Why i need to exit the country and come back pay 500??
Q127_R78_C3 Good
HI-Roeland... the cost for one exit is 10Qrs thats the governmet fees. And the fees for multiple exit is 500Qrs; this also from the govt. Usually one exit is more than enough for a normal employee and probably if he/she needs more travelling your sponsor can issue the exit when ever you needs it. And one important thing; if you are vanishing all of a sudden doing any illegal activities without the knowledge of the sponsor; he will be in trouble after you leave. So if you are contacting the sponsor each time for exit; he can ensure there is no complaints; bank loans; huge telephone bills; accident issues; over due in salary etc etc etc. Its highly adviceable for those who are into the field of business or frequent flyers... Its a matter of trust. And if you are flying atleast 30 times an year; you can say I need multiple exit. else its waste of money only. Hope the doubt is clear...

get the QR500 permit; its worth it! Especially the freedom.

Works smooth no problems only if you upgrade it then dandy is here go grab him from his throat. but i think you should stick to ver 1.1.1 [img_assist|nid=21285|title=.|desc=|link=none|align=left|width=|height=0]
Q129_R2_C2 Good
yap; iphone works here in qatar. actually many are using it. i have list of 500+ users of iphone and working fine & good. but i suggest getting version 1.1.1 first.. because the brand new iphone 1.1.2 now is not unlockable at the moment; but if u have TURBOSIM for 1.1.2 then all will be okay.
Q129_R2_C3 Bad
You seem to be so averse to version 1.1.2 could you pl let us know what problems you had/have with 1.1.2
Q129_R2_C4 PotentiallyUseful
Its a wonderful device which I am sure you will love using Just ensure you buy the old version which can be unlocked very easily here. From my previous post -------------- All the US iPhones that came on week 45 and after have the 1.1.2 firmeware; with the new bootloader version 4.6. Those phones can still be jailbroken and activated; but there is no software sim unlock solution yet. To find out the week on your iPhone check the 4th and 5th digit of serial number. This number can be found on the bottom of box in which you received the iPhone. if it is 45 and above then there is no software solution to unlock the phone right now; Hardware solution TurboSim is your only option I guess. If you Serial number indicates that it is less that 45 then your iPhone can be unlocked. If not your choices are 1. Use TurboSim or similar HW method to unlock. 2. Jailbreak the iPhone and use it like iPod touch till a software unlock method is published. hope this helps --------------

THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR THE ADVICE.. I WILL BE OFF TO BUY MY IPHONE tomorrow. Before I go.. can you please just clarify.. what exactly do I need to ask for when I go to the apple store ... I got the last digits on the Iphone.. is there anything else. Thanks a bunch!!! O yeah one other thing.. I need help when I come back to unlock.. anyone want to help me?? Thanks Fairy
Q129_R2_C6 Bad
That's great! Builds up my confidence into buying an iphone.. but than I get parnoid when you say that the 1.1.2 is not unlockable. I really dont have any knowledge.. of any of that.. or even what a 1.1.2 is or a 1.1.1. Do I tell them in the Apple store you better give me a 1.1.1? I am not going to know how to unlock it when I get to Qatar.. I think you can.. Maybe we can help each other out;; if you need something from the States;; I can get it for you;; or do some kind of deal;; so that you can unlock it for me... emmmmmmm or should I not be saying that here... o well;; all is good Thanks Fairy
Q129_R2_C7 PotentiallyUseful
You could ask for a phone whose manufacturing week is less than 45. ( which can be verified by the serial Number.) I wonder if apple stores will stock phones with less than 45 weeks manufacturing. You could try other sources besides apple as well. In the worst case apple iPhones are also available in Qatar except that they are slightly (or very) costly. As far as unlocking the phone is concerned have no worry. Dandy here seems to be an expert at it. Still if you have any problems unlocking let me know; I will do it for you and if required teach you how to do it. (without any deal.)

Fine tell me are all the application applicable on 1.1.2 ?? now does ver 1.1.2 too have that many applications as much for 1.1.1?? i dont say 1.1.1 is the best but am alot comfortable with this version. and if i had any problem with it dandy is still alive or hmm will try you next time. coz i still amnot done with nes. giving me big time headache.

Go to Ispot in City Center and ask them about the Iphone 4 release date. Regards!!
Q129_R8_C2 Good
Look; Apple said that they will be gradually increasing the number of countries that iPhone 4 will be shipped to over the next few months up till September. So a sure date would be some where in September cuz Qatar wont be top notch priority to Apple. We might recieve it a month or 2 earlier but chances are u wont be receiving it in Qatar until september unless u order an unlocked version from the USA which I think will be somewhere between $599 to like $900 depending on if its 16 GB or 32 GB and depending on where and when u buy it.Im also confused whether i should w8 for iPhone 4 or just buy the amazing and much cheaper Nexus One (Google Phone) which is some where between QR2500 to like QR2800 but i cant seem to make my mind.. HOPE THIS HELPS!!
Q129_R8_C3 PotentiallyUseful
To Correct some misinformed public and Alert the public from the scam artists in the cyber world who constantly attack this website and others due to the popularity of the Iphone in General; There are countries who sells iphones locked and some depending on the Agreement between Apple and the service providers. No where in the USA can you buy the iphone unlocked as the agreement between AT&T and Apple is to sell Iphone under contract or free from contracts but will only work under AT&T Sim cards only. Having said that anyone who is offering you an Iphone from USA simply ignore this; in europe your best bet is iphones sold in Italy; France and few others i cant remember all of them. Now that we cleared and alerted the QL public i can tell you if you can't wait until September which is the date to get it in the middle east try Europe but be Aware who you give your credit card details too i.e. use it wisely and be sure the person you're dealing with is legit.

Maybe I should do some more research on Islamic Customs; but can anyone explain why women are required to cover shoulders/knees in the first place? I'm very curious. Thanks."

Hi all. I'm back with yet another question. Thanks for bearing with me here. Just wondering what most women wear at the pool/beach in health clubs? Would you be uncomfortable in bikinis? (I read about the bikini ban at the diplomatic club)Can you wear shorts to walk around in a health club? I seem to be getting mixed views on this and am just curious as to what most women wear. Much thanks.
Q130_R36_C1 Good
Whatever you wear you will be stared at in Qatar specially if you are good looking. Make sure to go to all female health club if you dont want to get unwanted attention and stares. I just started going to gold gym and even there people raised eye brows when they saw me in shorts. So I have switched to long trousers just to avoid the unwanted attention I think some people here in Qatar have a serious problem of staring specially at the female gender.
Q130_R36_C2 Good
I think it's fine to wear a bikini(not thong bikini!) at the pool(except dip club)...noone really stares cause everyone who would actually go to the pool would open-minded and normal(ie not perv). As for shorts in the health club; I've seen women in shorts in mixed gyms; it was fine.
Q130_R36_C3 Good
If you are going to be living in a compound & using the pool there you should feel comfortable in your bikini. I try and avoid wearing mine in public places (except the 4seasons; which has a women's section anyway) ... there's always other options if you really wana avoid the stares!!

I swim with ladies who are almost fully clothed whilst I and others are wearing a costume or bikini and we chat away competely unconsciously.

Hi everyone! I worked in Qatar on April 2006 up to October 2009. I went to vacation with re-entry visa but did not come back. I dont have NOC and final exit visa. It is already 2 years & 3 months ago. I got a job offer now in Qatar. I just want to ask if there will be no problem for my future employer in applying visa for me? How will I check or how will I know if my ban is already finished?
Q131_R62_C1 PotentiallyUseful
I think there is a small catch here though. what if his employer realized that he is absconding and put a ban on him in feb 2010 instead of applying for a ban immediately ??? to be on the safer side; you can count 2 years from the date of your visa expired.
Q131_R62_C2 PotentiallyUseful
he does not have a final exit visa; but some sponsors can blacklist a person from entering the country.Is this the same ban as the 2 year NOC. hes not absonding; but he exited and never resumed work either. its a risk; but he may have to check with the company recruiting him; because only those HR officials can find out the actual situation; and where he stands.

But you can try; just don't blame anyone if you are not allowed to enter!
Q131_R62_C9 PotentiallyUseful
When your sponsors were told that you were not coming back from holiday; they would have proceeded quickly with cancelling your visa as they needed your visa free to allocate to somebody else. Companies have a certain number of visas allocated of certain nationalities and to replace a worker they have to cancel his visa; apply the ban and then reissue the visa to (in this case) your replacement. You can be safe to come back. As for the advise you are getting from others like flor; they should do their homework first instead of posting about subjects they know NOTHING about!!!

10000 should be deposited to ur account as salary every month..and once u have this for 6 mnths as bank statement you can apply for Family visa...but u need to have separate accomodation..with shared acco u will not get family visa...as alongwith your family visa papers ;the signed contract of accomodation has to be attached.
Q133_R86_C8 Bad
Manuprab - Did you say seperate 10 K and seperate accomodation. Along stretches of Mansoora; Najma; Al hilal and the areas around Salwa have noticed three to four families sharing small and cramped single rooms and flats. Sometimes even bachelors have been noticed to having bigger rooms then the families out here
Q133_R86_C9 PotentiallyUseful
It is not QR 10;000 plus accommodation. Immigration does not depict your total income so as long as you make more than that; you should be good to go. I've heard they are considering those who make less than 10;000 but more than 7;000; but they will also be looking at the position title.

any issue related to this is mainly because of political issue or non cooperation between Qatar and the other country. in plus; they are banned because of the palestinians who have jordanian papers. there are too many here and the qatari goverment should make equilibrium between all nationalities! i advice u not to ask for Borrow visa or to shift ur visa. u ll be banned 100%.
Q134_R40_C10 Good

Although babies born to expatriate parents are not entitled to Qatari citizenship; the birth still needs to be registered in Qatar; and a Qatari birth certificate issued (as well as a birth certificate from the parents' home country).

All births should be registered at the Women's Hospital (next to Hamad General Hospital on Al Rayyan Road); regardless of which hospital the baby was delivered in. The hospital where the delivery took place should issue two letters to the parents confirming the birth. These should then be taken to the Women's Hospital; along with the following documents: A copy of the child's vaccination card The passports of both parents Copies of the parents' Residence Permits The parents' marriage certificate There is some paperwork to fill out; and a fee per certificate is payable.

Q138_R10
I have been told that the Qatari government is about to introduce a minimum wage of 1460 QR per month for house maids. The sponsor having to pay it directly into the employee's bank account. Anyone with more information?
Q138_R10_C1 Good
There was a meeting held at Philippine embassy last week and they tackled about this matter. One of the requirements in submitting agreements in embassy is Labor contract signed by the sponsor indicating the salary of $400. We are still waiting for the confirmation of the additional requirement. Once the labor contract will be attached to the housemaid's agreement; the indicated salary will be implemented.
Q138_R10_C2 Bad
Really too much; and in this case my advice to the concerned people to stop bringing house maids from Philippine as many people can not afford 400 USD.
Q138_R10_C3 Bad
QAR 1;460 ?? Do you really know what these maids actually earn ? They are treated as slaves.
Q138_R10_C4 Bad
If true; it's a move in the right direction. Anyone who pays their maid less than that is nothing more than a slave owner.
Q138_R10_C5 Bad
Its a Step Forward... If you can't Afford a House Maid; don't hire one... Better late then never!

Q138_R10_C8 PotentiallyUseful
When I bought over a maid for slightly less monthly sum I was informed by my colleagues that m paying her too much - they pay around USD 200 - 250. In the interest of all there should be a minimum wage however my maid sends home 95 % of her salary - I remit it myself to her mothers account. She eats th same food as us; has her independence and is happy - her brother out here keeps thanking my friend for the recommendation. The point is the salary I'm paying is less than the OP cap and she is more than happy. It is in multiples of what she was earning back home

I have been doing research on this MBA thing in Doha for the last one year or more but so far I have found nothing worthwhile. The only options available were at Qatar university but I am not sure about its credentials and the second option was National education center somewhere near Lulu. They offer MBA evening classes couple of times a week and the degree we get is from Allagappa university of Madras. The third option is Doha Training Center; they had an ad in the papers a few weeks ago. They too are offering MBA thu some American university or atleast that is what they claimed but when I went there to check it out; it turned out to be some American university based in the Phillipines. Even the degree that we would get after completing it would say Phillipines on it. So I decided that it is better to do some distance MBA from my own country Pakistan than to go for that.. If any of you find out some good and recognized MBA degree being offered in Qatar; please let me know. Thanks

Calls will be charged at one minute intervals. 3.When calling from your mobile; the local mobile price per minute will be added to the above listed Qtel international call rates. For example; if you call the Emirates at 11 pm for 1 minute from a postpaid GSM line; you will be charged only 0.80 (QR 0.50 international rate + QR0.30 local rate).

Hello; Although; they count by minutes; and it costs 1 QR for each call; Dawli Card is an excellent service. I will tell you an example. two days ago; I talked to all of my friends in Saudi Arabia by Dawli card. The call duration was 53 minutes!! but how much was it cost? only 27.5 QR !! which is excellent. 53 is nearly one hour and it is fine for an international call. If I called by my mobile phone directly; this will cost 53* 1.43 = 75.79 QR !! So; from dawli card; I saved only around 48.29 QR. I didn't try for the rest of the word but I think it would have the same idea. Taking an example; to call to someone in philippines; let's take 30 minutes; it will cost in the case of using mobile phone ( Monthly billing ) around 2.27*30 = 68.1 QR; and with Hala; 74.1 QR.. but with Dawli; it will cost 38.5 QR so that you save 29.5 from mobile monthly billing and 35.5 from Hala. At the end; you choose what is the best for you :) I know that there are many websites that give you low rates but i.....

Dubai's credibility of keeping the workers on their jobs and not looking into exodus are more overwhelming to me. I was more excited when they showcase Palm Jumeirah's opening but after the spectacular events; the country's market went into a limbo; more job lay-offs.

(do people not answer emails in qatar? must. get. phonecard) .. in the meantime.. is it a good idea to look for a place to live only after we know where the schools will be?
Q140_R7_C1 Good
Unless you enjoy the challenge of Doha traffic for at least 30 - 40 minutes both ways (drop off and pick up) depending on where you live. Or even longer if your home location is really out of whack. Traffic during school run times here is atrocious; and that's when it is moving.
Q140_R7_C2 Bad
thanks mary! from what i've read on here; it doesn't look like i'd be driving around right away anyway and i assume there are no school buses.. man; this is overwhelming!
Q140_R7_C3 PotentiallyUseful
Some schools do have buses (for an extra fee); the problem is with the timings - I've seen kids out as early as 0530 hrs waiting for their bus (and school doesn't actually start until 0700 or 0730 hrs). However; they seem to be mainly Arab or Asian children - so I assume they are attending Arab or Asian schools. You need to get your kids' on the waiting lists for your preferred schools now as the better schools that have the American and British Curriculum are very popular with those expat (and other) communities. Try expatwoman dot com for some more contacts and ideas (they have a list of schools and various items of interest to people new to Qatar)
Q140_R7_C4 Good
Proximity matters enormously; because traffic is horrendous in the mornings. Bus services are private and run in coordination with some of the schools; including the American School.

I'm assuming you wan to send them to an American school; you can always try applying at the middle east international school; they follow American curriculm. There are lots of new big villas for rent right next to the school. Walking distance; was going to send mine to ASD but I refuse to pay ridiculous fees so they can pay off their campus.
Q140_R7_C6 PotentiallyUseful
It is a good idea to first check out the schools; then decide on where to live. Close proxinity is a good thing; but it all depends on the area and the traffic. You can only make this judgement after looking at alternatives.
Q140_R7_C7 Bad
you guys are a huge help; honestly i'm so glad to have found this place. will check out the expat site; ironically i was on expatwomen.com which is pretty useless .. not the same as expatwoman.com .. so thanks for that tip! ok so I would prefer an American curriculum but that's not a priority. we *plan* on leaving in five years; and that would mean my eldest does high school back in the states which hopefully she can readjust to. as long as the teachers are good; i expect my kids will thrive. i have a friend who says that british kids bully the american ones so that's my only real concern (since spelling and history can't really count ;)) i will also check out middle east intn'l school which i hadn't heard of; along with asd; acs; and compass intn'l. (am i missing anything?) wish it were as simple as arriving; finding a school; and moving into a place.. but everything depends on the other; so it's a bit confusing right now.

They've hired an American principal at the school; and let me tell you he's a no nonsense type of man. They also asked for a behavioral report; which I was not able to get in Canada.

Q140_R7_C9 PotentiallyUseful
during your school search: 1. Are they accredited and by whom? Basically to make sure your children's scores/records are accepted when you move back. 2. What after school activities do they offer? 3. Teacher accreditation. What % have 4 year teaching degrees and or masters degrees. You'd be surprised at who some schools will accept and pass off as teachers.
Q140_R7_C10 Bad
those are great tips.. I am assuming I'd have to email or call the schools since I don't see that info readiily available on the websites. Will do that as I narrow schools down. Looks like we have to pay all the fees up front; and it is adding up to be a big chunk of change. Going to do one school at a time. Speaking of after school activities.. Do you know if they offer fencing; archery and gymnastics? That's what my girls are enrolled in here...

http://www.asd.edu.qa/pages/sitepage.cfm?page=32659 Above is the link for ASD (American School of Doha). We don't have kids; but I am a teacher and we have heard wonderful things about ASD. I believe; but can stand to be corrected; that they are in the process of building a new middle/high school campus expected to be open for the 2007-2008 school year. One thing I would consider is whether or not your son will be able to come here and remain here for all of high school. While the transition to a school in Doha may be pretty easy; the transition back to a school in the states to complete say senior year might be a challenge. Just something to consider. We moved here from the states a couple of months ago; so please feel free to email us if you have any other questions! Good luck!

Thank you MandG. I have visited their site and it looks pretty good. I was just trying to get a parent's or teacher's opinion. I am still on the fence right now. I did see their list of sports and they do not include football or baseball (his two true passions). We have lived in the Middle East before; 7 yrs in Saudi Arabia. Our oldest son did boarding school in the states. As far as how long; that is another question. Just so hard being apart from the hubby. Thanks again; I really appreciate it.
Q140_R11_C3 Good
My husband and I just visited Doha a couple of weeks ago and did a tour of the ASD. We have two children both good students and active in sports. One will be in 8th grade and one will be in 10th grade. We were impressed with both the academic curriculum (their AP courses were excellent) and the sports programs offered. We were told that the teams compete against other American schools in the Middle East which we found to be very interesting. Also a lot of opportunity to travel and experience other cultures in an academic setting. Just a note though - we were told their football is not American football but soccer. The new building is almost complete and should be ready for the start of the new school year and will house the middle and high school.
Q140_R11_C4 Bad
Thanks for that information. I pretty much assumed that there was no gridiron football there; but is there baseball? The schools website listed softball for boys and girls. If I knew that he could continue in one of his sports that would be a big help. My husband was trying to find out for me; but he has been swamped with the project that he is working on. Your comments are very encouraging. Thanks again.

With all the long waiting lists for children getting into the private schools; what happens? Are there many home school groups or private tutor groups in Doha? Or do families go back to their home countries until they can get a place. Any feedback on this will be appreciated.
Q140_R12_C1 Good
I don't know if this is a very popular option. There is a tutoring place here called Cedars and I think some people use this while they are waiting for school places. Tel 468 8192 email cedarstutoring@hotmail.com Getting school places is a problem in Doha but if you have a British passport; you have a better chance than some because you will be given priority in the British curriculum schools. I'm sure you've probably researched which ones are popular here - any that come under the umbrella of BSME (British Schools of the Middle East) and are not-for-profit are generally sound - They have a website www.bsme.org.uk Obviously the best option would be to come over to Doha on a 'look see' visit so that you can check out the schools yourself. In any event; if you are looking for places to start September 2007; you need to act now as it may take 3 - 6 months to go through the process of applying/entrance tests for secondary children etc If have children at secondary and primary level I would.....

Based on comments on QL; both are terrible schools. Are there really no other options? If not; choose the nearest and start applying for schools for next year as soon as possible. Perhaps you can switch schools within a term or two.
Q140_R28_C2 Good
Can't say I've trawled the forums like Bachus but I haven't seen anything negative about Loydence Academy. But as a parent of a pupil at Loydence Academy last year I can happily recommend the school from experience. Last January we had the choice of Newton or Loydence; after visiting both we chose Loydence despite being a long way from our accomodation in West Bay. My son went into year 3 and progressed very well. The school follow the English curriculum to a high standard and my son was very happy there. The downside is the lack of sporting facilities; but last year was their first year at Aziziya and we witnessed lots of new equipment and students arriving over time. Our son has secured a place at a school closer to home which means he no longer has to get up at 5am and my wife endure 3 hours daily on the road! If you want any more info please drop me a line.

Thanks; Mike. Maybe I am confusing the two. I'm just going by the numerous threads with long posts from parents complaining about the quality of facilities; teachers and management of the Newton schools. I've see Loydence--and those comments seemed targeted more to the usual complaints about a new school starting up. I'm glad you found a school you like. I think the OP's best option is to visit both; and go with what feels right. Then; to be on the safe side; apply early for other schools. If the OP is happy with the original school; then nothing is lost; but if the school is unsatisfactory; the children will have the option to transfer into something better.

Q141_R48_C9 Bad
"Skype PC to PC is ok; but PC to phone bypasses their ""telecoms"" service; which is then classified as illegal; otherwise you have to inform Qtel that you will be using such service; just like what we have in the company; and we have to pay for the service of every unit of VoIP phone. just my 2 cents guys. It's not because things are difficult that we don't dare; it's because we don't dare that makes things difficult!"
Q141_R48_C10 Bad
Maybe that's the case for businesses. But there were official announcements in the newspapers a couple of weeks back explaining that it's ok to use VoIP (PC to PC and PC to Phone).

Kumar; Well; you can come and take a chance; there are jobs available for Indians but as you said; it is not that easy or abundant. Still your luck and merit counts. Better try to stay for 3 months; in 1 month nothing will materialise unless you know some big shots to take care of you. But do not resign your current job. Hold on as standby.

Q141_R55
Yesterday morning i checked my Commercial Bank Account and a fee of Qr 50/- was deducted from my account as an Annual Debit Card Fee For each debit card. No any other bank is deducting that because of financial crises they are impossing these charges to overcome the loses. What is you opinion of Deducting that amount from Account without any notification?
Q141_R55_C1 Good
debit cards are normally issued at no charges; if yours get damaged and u requested a reissue before expiry date .. they charge around 50 or 100 riyals is it your case? if not; thats really bad .. u might need to write them a complain comparing their charges to other banks
Q141_R55_C2 Bad
No; card not got damage or reissue; its the new charges introduce 50 riyals for every year.
Q141_R55_C3 Bad
Same here....called them up and they said its a new charge and now will be charged every year (Bloody thieves!)

Q141_R55_C8 Good
ya believe they should have informed all of their customers before deducting this much money from the accounts of the clients. just imagine that how many accounts they will be having with them and just multiply it with Qr.50 . 1;00;000 x 50 = Qr.5;00;000/ and they have far more clients as per my judgment. now may be one day they will add the expense of ATM card also if we use it in any other Bank ATM.i came to know that for each transaction the banks change Qr.2 to the Bank who's card is it. so prepare ur self may be this expense will also come to us.

Q142_R61
Hi guys. I am looking at 3 possible apartments to rent in : Bilal studios al asmak Y village al waab Zig zag tower. Anyone have any views on these places? They are all similar prices but y village is 24 month contract; is this safe? Is there anything I need to watch out for or ensure I do when renting one of these properties? Thank you!
Q142_R61_C1 Good
it also depends on the area you want to live in. It looks like all of them are in the opposite sides of the city. I personally eliminated Bilal studios al asmak for the area reason. Is it somewhere on A-ring road; correct? I simply hate this area. Zig Zag sounds better in terms of area; but again i have heard so many negative responses regarding this place; that I cannot advise on it. Not familiar with Y village.. is that a compound? building? who is the owner?
Q142_R61_C2 Good
Just curious... have you checked out these places already? They have very different things to offer in terms of size; view; location; amenities etc. If renting anywhere around West Bay/Dafna area (which includes the zigzag); the one thing you need to watch out for is the additional charge for the aircon i.e. Qatar cool. In some cases; the landlord takes care of it. More often; they don't. Depending on the size of the apartment; I must warn you it is not a nominal charge.
Q142_R61_C3 Bad
"what do you mean ""additional charge for the aircon i.e. Qatar cool'? you have to pay for electrisity; dont you? what is qatar cool?"
Q142_R61_C4 Bad
This is in addition to electricity. You're charged for aircon 'capacity' and usage on top of what Karhama charges for electricity. I'm not sure how they calculate the amount but for further details; google Qatar Cool or search for it in QL.
Q142_R61_C5 Bad
I have not visited them yet no. I'm moving over in 2 weeks and have viewings set up. Y village seems to be my top pick at the moment. It's developed by ramco; how are these guys to deal with? The issue I have is the 24 month contract; it seems pretty restrictive. What if after 6/9 months I hate living there due to various issues? Bilal is on A ring; what's wrong with this area? Thanks!
Q142_R61_C6 Bad
Sorry I believe it's 'ramaco' and not ramco
Q142_R61_C7 Good
where is your office? your options are in completely different sides of Doha. If your office is in West Bay; you better take ZigZag tower; as you will spend at least 30-40 minutes coming from this Y-Village (still not sure where it is exactly; looks like new development; and sounds pretty far.)and going back there. Do you need it? I don't like A-Ring becuase this is old bad area. Everything is old and ugly there. Simple. You need to know where our office is.
Q142_R61_C8 PotentiallyUseful
Qatarisun has a very good point. You should consider your work location. As for the duration of the contract; best to choose a place and then negotiate a deal you are most comfortable with. You don't have to sign for 24 months but you may have to commit to at least a year. But you can try negotiating - you never know it might work.
Q142_R61_C9 Bad
The office is in west bay. Would it really take up to 40 mins to travel there? That's not ideal. I thunk I'd like to live in a compound as I feel like there is a bit more freedom than a huge tower block. Is there anything like that in westbay? Y village isn't even open yet as it is a new build. Does anyone know of any similar apartments in close proximity to westbay for a max of 8k per month? Thanks!
Q142_R61_C10 Good
in West bay no such prices for compounds. Not too many compunds there either. Mostly towers... Only may be somewhere in Golf Club area; but it's again pretty far. I think your best choice with your location and budget is either ZigZag or Ezdan. Although both of them are not the best quality; as actually everything in Qatar. At least you will be close to your office. By the way; I think in Ezdan you can rent for short term; such as 1 or 2 month. And then you will have time to look around; and find somthing that you like.

Grocery - can't beat the Lulu Hypermarket near Landmark. The Carrefour in Landmark has lost a lot of business to them - the selection and freshness of vegies are much better at the Lulu. The Carrefour has the remainders from the rest of the chain it seems (lots of expired stuff at times). Coffee / Tea - get the tea at any supermarket. Coffee at Starbucks / Costa Coffee / Second cup. The stuff in the supermarkets is aweful. I've been buying my coffee while overseas at specialty shops and bringing it back (i'm almost out of my Costa Rica trip and am wondering what to do now!).

What happened here? Seems to me some of us were having a sensible discussion about prostitution in Qatar and the thread vanished??? Am I missing something? I did not see anything deserving of sensoring/editing unless we look at the original post; and I am sure that could have been dealt with seperately and so keeping the thread 'alive'. Or is it being implied that we bury our head in the sand and pretend it does not exist here? Can we continue here ...................?

It's not that China; it was deleted because the thread was trolling and promoting prostitution; such threads that promote something whether it was prostitution or otherwise gets deleted. But it wasn't cause of the topic itself so we can continue here :-)

Q145_R32_C3 Good
So let's talk about it here! :-) I'm surprised that prostitution is that open in what is considered a conservative country; I mean if it's so obvious that these women are prostituting them; then I'm sure authorities know about it...the question is...why aren't they doing anything about it ?
Q145_R32_C4 Good
OK; thats understandable; thank you. It also underlines mir83 and my point that we believed prostitution is less tolerable here in Qatar. However; the fact remains that prostitution is wide spread in certain places in Qatar and thrives; until something is said by somebody; and then the routine mass deportations take place. It goes quiet for a while; and then the 'night girls' start building up in numbers again to the level they are now. My last sentence; before the previous thread was deleted was something like this; 'mark my words; the ladies will vanish any day now. Over the few weeks after that; their numbers will slowly increase again; and the cycle repeats it's self'. Obviously somebody is behind this (a pimp); as a sponsor for these girls.
Q145_R32_C5 Good
If someone is actually behind this (which I believe so); it has to be someone in a high position; someone who has control over authorities...what other explanation is there for the lack of action by the authorities ?
Q145_R32_C6 Bad
Cornellian; somebody answered this on the previous thread just before it was deleted. I cannot recall the poster; but it was suggested that some body in authority; possible with some 'wasta' to throw around; was probably behind it. My apologies if I have not recalled what was said precisely; but I would go along with that theory anyway. There are just far too many girls; far too often; in so many places for it to be anything else. Unless somebody knows differently ofcourse ................?
Q145_R32_C7 Good
looks like we are on the same wave length here. I would guess that the authorities are 'bending' to a certain extent under the threat of this 'person's' wasta. The final breaking point is probably reached when the religious fraternity start to object/speak out.

But i really think that the ads are placed there by google and not QL. To be fair to QL; Many similar ads which were posted earlier (like Muslimamarriage.com or something if I remember correctly) are no longer here. Give it some time and I'm sure this shall find it's rightful place in the dustbin too... My two pennie's worth!

Hi; I want to inquire anyone who knows the procedure on how to come in Qatar via direct hire? My son has a job offer here in Qatar;visa and contract is ready; but since the company is new they dont know the hiring process of direct hire from Philippines. Anybody who gone thru the same kindly share the info on what steps to undergo. Thanks.
Q147_R14_C1 Good
i was direct hired also; the thing i remember is that i have my offer letter and stamped visa from qatar embassy in manila (processed thru dhl together with my police and nbi clearance and medical certificate) and my flight schedule. Processed my OEC in POEA 2nd floor and it took me about 2weeks since they require a letter from the company stating that they are in-charge in sending our corpse if we die here in doha (foolish thing). but if you want your relative to come too soon without any hassels in Ninoy A. airport give him a Singapore Tour Package and then from there another ticket to Doha. He can print his Doha workvisa and keep it with him that he may present it in NDIA immigration here which is hassel free.

I don't think direct hiring is still allowed. You have to go through an agency in the Philippines who is accredited to hire for your employer. Check with POEA to be sure. Best of luck:)

DHL is no longer processing for visa stamping. And it is too risky to exit to other Asian country and exit from there coming to Qatar; the immigration in other Asian countries are already informed about these back door exits; hence departure from there coming to other countries might be disallowed. If you're interested; send me message and I can give you the no. of an agent who is processing for deployment; meaning work visa will be processed thru POEA legally. He processed for my sister's work visa. Anyhow; you can try other means if you want to take the risk.
Q147_R14_C6 Good
Hi; Being a direct hire from the Philippines entails a lot of head ache considering the red tape in Manila if could be very frustrating until the very end. With so many requirements to prepare and a lot more; chances are you will not be able to come to Qatar in just 30 days (if you are lucky enough). I am a Recruitment Officer in Doha and I bring people from Manila via the Bangkok route; meaning you book yourself as tourist to Bangkok (round trip ticket; a night stay in a hotel) and the following day you can board a plane to Doha. Honestly; we get nothing from the government not even a good service. SMS me and I will tell you this way; when you arrive in Doha; just register at the Polo Office.
Q147_R14_C7 Good
Kabayan; there are no more direct hire employees coming from the Philippines. There should be a job order filed by the employer through the Embassy here. This job order is to be given to an accredited recruitment agency. This is to assure and guarantee the safety of the employee to be hired. In short; there will be placement fees; pre-employment medical; PDOS; visa processing; etc. Cumbersome; time consuming but safe. The above comments pertains to getting here via a visiting visa or business visa. This is an option but personally; not advisable. You choice. Good Luck.

the letter of invitation required by the embassy of Qatar for visa authentication is different from the affidavit of support required by Philippine immigration.

Hi. Just make a letter to the addressee indicating the purpose of the visit and that you will take care of the needs of the visitor preferably in company letter head. For direct relative usually affidavit of support from the embassy here is not needed but for assurance you may want to get one. Send her these letters; your PP; QID; employment certificate and RT tickets and she will be fine. That is provided your mom is not more than 60 years old. Good Luck.

I have my papers under process for evaluation at SCH; and the result was as follows: evaluation pending; sit for exam; I have scheduled my exam on the 31st of may here in the Philippines; BUT I only have 2 yrs experience; If I pass the prometric exam; is there a chance for me to pass the evaluation asl well? Thank you.
Q147_R36_C1 Good
kamusta kabayan? to sum up all the process required by the SCH Qatar; you need these 4 very MAJOR important things. 1. Passed the Prometric Exam 2. minimum 2 years paid hospital or clinical experience (volunteer isnt counted and considered) 3. BS Nursing Degree holder 4. Registered Nurse (with active license not expired) in your home country The evaluation which will be conducted by Dataflow is just one of the steps for you able to get licensed here. FYI; Dataflow doesnt need your Prometric Exam in the Evaluation Stage. Dataflow will only needs the 2;3&4. Once u've passed the Evaluation; you will proceed to Licensing Stage. For you able to pass this stage; you need to PASS the PROMETRIC

Really?? But why is it that they are letting me take the exam if I dont have a chance in passong the evaluation?
Q147_R36_C6 Good
Supreme Council of Health also dont know if you can pass either the evaluation or the exam. SCH is a government health agency here who contracted and rely to these 2 private agency (DataFlow and Prometric) to verify your credential(DataFlow) and to test your nursing knowledge and skills(Prometric). They let you to take the exam becaause Evaluation results takes time to finished (sometimes more than 6months). SCH wanted you to sit for your Prometric while waiting for the result probably because 1. they assume that you could pass it and 2. if you failed; at least you have time to retagke it while waiting for the evaluation result
Q147_R36_C7 Good
After passing the Prometric and DataFlow doesnt mean that you can get a license right then and then. You need to pass other requirements such as medical; vaccine; police clearance; sponsor letter; nursing visa; certificate of good standing; etc.) in order to for them (SCH) to issue a license.

Q148_R12
Hi all; I've finally received the official offer from QP and I think I'm being lowballed. The offer is QR23;000 + 14;200 housing and school and benefits. They put me in grade 16. I don't know anything about these grades. Can anyone enlight me and tell me also how much I can negotiate? I read some mixed discussions about the leeway I have for negotiation. I was expecting QR35;000 basic; realistic?. Thx in advance
Q148_R12_C1 Good
35;000 is out of reach for grade 16; however; there is always a room for negotiation provided that you afford risking the job as they aren't normally that keen have a particular applicant for the job. They don't even care if it takes them more couple of months to fill the vacancy.
Q148_R12_C2 PotentiallyUseful
open their website and you can apply online.. ^try to negotiate more buddy...
Q148_R12_C3 Good
Realisticly you are making $6;300 per month; with paid accommodation and free children's education etc etc. I don't see how you are being low balled when the majority of your basic income is going to be savings because your overheads are being paid for by QP already. Even if your current job position you are making more then $6300; the chances of saving anything are highly unlikely. Also remember their are promotions; yearly appraisals and the big fat bonus's every year. If you do the annual gross income on your basic salary with the above you could be pulling easily 28;000-30;000 per month :) Don't miss this opportunity!! Most ppl on QL dream to have a offer like this!! Good luck!
Q148_R12_C4 Bad
How much were you getting at your previous job; have you mentioned that in your CV ??
Q148_R12_C5 Good
Normally QP does not negotiate packages; it is either you take it or leave it. They have hundreds of applicants looking to join QP. That salary is a lower end of grade 16. Normally there is no promotion in QP unless you are a Qatari or someone within GCC and you do get bonuses depending on your rating. Your annual bonus for an everage rating on your salary is around 34000 QAR and after 4 years you get 6000 QAR furniture maintenance annually. On top of the salary they will give you an expatriate allowance of about 3000 per month depending on which european country you come from and a car allowance of QAR 2000.00 per month. So basically its not bad.

Q148_R12_C7 PotentiallyUseful
takes care of your single biggest expense.I'm not a QP employee so could be wrong; but dont they take care of tuition for upto 4 kids? US/UK schools here will cost you north of QAR 40K annually....and that is for PRE-K !!!! As to whether they are low-balling you;maybe. But without knowing details of your qualifications;current pay etc its hard to tell.Take into consideration the point I've made about schooling expense and those made by others on this thread. That said; I will say there is always room for a counter-offer.Just be smart with the number you go backto them with.Also depends on how much of a hard-ass the person you are dealing with is and at this point;I would imagine you have some idea.
Q148_R12_C8 PotentiallyUseful
If you're going to be the office tea boy - it's magnificent. If you are a professional (engineer) with years of experience and a senior management position; it's garbage. One note - school fees and housing (depending on where and how you wish to live) can be very expensive. Do some research on school fees and look at ads for the type of housing you would find satisfactory. Your question can be answered; if you provide more details on your education/experience and what job you are being offered.
Q148_R12_C9 Bad
School fees and housing are paid for by the company. I'm in corporate fin with over 10 years experience in North America. We are making here more than what was offered; that's why we are thinking to counter offer as I'm gonna be the only one working there. Can anyone who knows QP policies tell me what amount to ask for to get a good trade-off; and if I can ask for grade jump from 16 to 17? As reminder I was offered 23k basic. Thx
Q148_R12_C10 Good
If you are making more in NA then stay put. Also their offer might increase by 2000 or so but won't be significantly different. As to the grade increase; this is not very likely as they cannot have someone doing the same job on a different grade. Creates a lot of problems for them
Q148_R27
Ive lived in UAE ; BAHRAIN ; SAUDI . When it comes to renting a place ; the commission is paid by the landlord. He has hired this agent to find a person to rent the apartment ; isnt it his job to pay the person he hired ? Why do we have to pay the person who put an advertisement in the newspaper ? Just because he showed us the flat ; we have to pay half the rent to him? In other areas in the middle east ; the landlord pays ; not us ? Please advice!

Nope ; they take it all from us .:( This is basically robbing. There is no contract between you and the realtor.

"I thought Muttawah means ""Muslim Holy Person""; cause there are a few guys with long beards and short dis-das or thoub (Don't know if the spelling is right). Not as strict; however; you need to respect the law of the land. Having said that; Qatar is more open than Saudi. We have different religious gatherings within the country approved by the govt. There is a syndicate where you can buy booze (as long as you get a basic salary of Qrs.4;000/-). The star hotels serve booze. You can stay out late at night without being questioned; unless you walk funny. List anything specific you would like to know??"

Q149_R22_C3 Good
They do; but do not intefere with westerners or any other. Read some of the other post and you will see; Qatar is moving towards a more cosmopolitan city. If you are in Saudi; means you are a GCC Resident; you can walk into qatar airport and get a visa on arrival. Come and experience the city for a few days to get a feel. It is pretty good compared to Saudi; the only thing that gets us residence; is the spiraling house rents. Peace

Qatar by constitution law follows the wahabi heritage since 1970.Howerver; there is a tolarance in its practices in Qatar.

So far; it's been very helpful in banishing my doubts.

Q149_R37_C10 Good
I have used vodafone for 6 months; but am now going to return to Qtel. On vodafone; my calls drop off at least once a day due to connection error. Twice a day I can expect to answer a call and get some bizarre harsh static noise on the phone; and at least once a week it will take redialing 10 times for the call to go through as the network is busy. I am all for competition and would have enjoyed seeing vodafone succeed; but unfortunately no amount of special deals or high gloss marketing can offset a poor network.
Q149_R48
Qtel offers 512k; 1MB; and 2MB ADSL for 200;300; or 400QR per month. I am moving to a place where I will have to decide which subscription. Would like some advice from experienced people. Is the extra speed worth it? Is the speed difference noticeable? I ask the question because the place where I am living now provides an Internet connection via a cable and the speed of the connection varies a lot.
Q149_R48_C1 Good
We have the 200 QR/month and I find it very fast. It does slow down from time to time but overall I'm happy with it.
Q149_R48_C2 Good
is terrible. Really avoid and pay a little more to get something faster. The sooner QTel lose their monopoly and some decent competition comes in the better. Good luck!
Q149_R48_C3 Good
Depends on your usage. I have the 2Mbps (400 Riyals). It's a big bill every month when you factor in the landline and mobile (s) charges.
Q149_R48_C4 Good
If I was moving; I would be looking at Qtel's Mozaic offering which is being advertised all over town on the bill boards. One gets telephone; broadband at 100MBs (I am not 100% sure on this speed; but its mega fast ) and televsion all through a telephone cable for something like QR 300 per month with a once-off installation fee.. There was an earlier discussion thread on QL when Qtel failed to roll out this Mozaic Tripleplay in December; but it seems they are ready. I cannot find any reference to it on their website; and I could only get info about it from the main Qtel branches. The kiosks in the malls will not be able to help you. These prices are very tempting compared with ADSL alone.
Q149_R48_C5 Good
there's no way Q-tel will give u 100mbs for 300 riyals!! i'm pretty sure its 512kb only; considering you get tv; tele; and internet its a pretty good deal. plus u get over a hundred channels just on the basic package. i'm happy with my 2mb connection however i have done some tweaks here and there to increase my download speeds which is a must for downloading movies...
Q149_R48_C6 Bad
Why would you want Q-Tel's TV offer? For the censored and time-delayed content?
Q149_R48_C7 Good
Hi man; I don't know for what do you want to use the internet connection; but: 1- If you want it only for browsing then get the [512KB] it is more than enough for browsing. 2- If you want it for browsing and watching online videos; download some stuff from here and there get the [1MB]. 3- If you are using the torrents to download movies; music and can't live your day if you did not download something; then get the [2MB]. The speed difference can be noticed when you start downloading from a static IP or a direct download. The range goes like: 1- [512KB] up to 80 if you were lucky; most of the time between 60 and 70] 2- [1MB] up to 120 but most of the time the range is from 90 - 110. 3- [2MB] up to 200 but most of the time the range is from 140 - 180. You should notice the download speed varies according also to the upload speed [especially torrent files]; if you start for example downloading 3 torrents in the same file and one of them was having an upload rate of your maximum connection.....

Q150_R3_C1 Good
how is she gonna live with you without the residence permit? She can only visit you for 2 month by obtaining a visa on arrival at the airport. Then she has to leave. The is no problem with visiting.. she can stay wherever she wants. To stay permanently she has to have an RP (residence permit) under sponsorship of either a company that she works for or yourself as a husband only.
Q150_R3_C2 Good
It is illegal to cohabit if you are not married. Dress is conservative. Long shorts for men ; covered shoulders and knees for women in public. Apart from that its easy going.

Q150_R3_C5 Good
Do a basic search on the boards. Worst case scenario - you are discovered; arrested; jailed and deported. All it takes is one nosey or disgruntled neighbour or colleague at work. Do people do this? Yes. Are you willing to risk the consequences? Only you can decide. And as QS pointed out - how is your partner going to stay here legally? If you are in company accomodation; everyone around you and your HR dept will be well aware of your (non) marital status. That is a big no-no for them as well.
Q150_R3_C6 Good
it is illegal for UN married couples to live together
Q150_R3_C7 Bad
So if she visits me does that mean she cannot enter the place where I live and I cannot enter where ever it is she staying. I obviously will respect the law and their cultural beliefs and I do not want to risk getting arrested or deported; that is why I want to know exactly what is acceptable and what is not.
Q150_R3_C8 Good
It's not a matter of acceptable; it's a matter of legality. Unmarried people are not allowed to live together here legally. Full stop. Employers are also sensitive to this as they are held legally responsible for employee's behaviour/actions in many cases. If you are living in non-employer provided accomodation and you are both white/European looking; and you are extremely discrete; you'll probably be OK. But you need to know the consequences in order to make an informed decision.

They will get visa on arrival and it is much cheaper than going thru hotel. If you want to make it all easier for them just pay for Almaha services and they will be served with a different queue and go thru much quicker. Anyway it will not be an issue. If they ask where they are staying just say with family and do not go into detail. Anyway; how can immigration tell if they are not married?

I will be arriving in Doha on the 10th or 11th of December. My wife will be flying in approximately two weeks later and will be staying with me on my sponsorship for the duration of my contract. When she steps off of the plane in Doha; she will have her passport; but I don't know what else she needs in order to stay in the country with me. Can she get some sort of visitor visa or what? I am not sure what to do here. thanks everyone.
Q150_R14_C1 PotentiallyUseful
I am not too sure on all the formailities however; would suggest that you get in touch with your embassy. As far as I know; yor wife needs a RP (residence Permit) which can only be done once you have yours. If she come on the Visit visa; she will only be able to stay a few months and will have no rights (Hospital; Bank account finding a job etc). Not to say that she can not come on the Visit Visa but she would have to leave after the Visa expired and apply for a Residency under your name from her country unless she has her own sponslor in Qatar.
Q150_R14_C2 Bad
I already have my visa - it's waiting for me once I get there. Given that; wouldn't she be able to come in under my sponsorship and apply for her residence at that point?
Q150_R14_C3 Good
You can sponsor your wife only when you have RP (residence permit) in hands. It will take approximately a month for you to get one; from the moment of entry and one more month to do the paperwork for your wife. My suggestion - ask your sponsor now; because they will have to help you with it.
Q150_R14_C4 Good
Chbck; your wife can come on a company business visa for 3 months renewable 3X. Once you get your RP; you can transfer her sponsorship under you; coz the company will give her No Objection Cert.; She doesn't need to exit and go back to her country. Once you applied for her the business visa; you just need to obtain a supporting affidavit from your embassy that you will shoulder all her expenses during the period. Trust me I did it for my cousin; though her sponsor was transfered to her company; and she got residence now. Good luck!
Q150_R14_C5 Bad
Ok great; so let me make sure I understand what you are all saying. 1. My visa is good enough to get her in when she gets off the plane with nothing more than her passport. 2. She can get any other kind of visas that she needs to get once she's in the country and they won't make her go home. 3. If I leave for Doha on December 9th and she leaves for Doha on December 18th; we will be able to spend Christmas together. I understand that I should probably talk to my sponsor about all this too. thanks a million yall
Q150_R14_C6 Good
Waiiiit! Number 2. You have to apply the visa first from here (Doha) then send the visa no. to her so; she can print out from the net www.moi.gov.qa ;if she needs a copy. Visa application is just within 2 days(it depends). She just need her passport in the airport here coz her visa details is already in the computer network system in Immigration Doha Airport. Yes sure; you can possibly spend Xmas together but u must apply soon as u reached Doha.

There is still a way for her to come but under any company business visa or a tourist visa (but 28 days only...also 3x renewable from travel agency); then transfered to your sponsor once you got ur RP. And she don't need to go back to her country. For the supporting affidavit; I think the best way is to get from her sponsoring company coz u dont have RP yet that time; right?

Q152_R14_C1 Good
Not necessary to wait such long time for exit permit. If the company licence is expired; your mandoop can make the exit permit by paying Qr.100/- at the immigration.
Q152_R14_C2 Bad
But the company mandoop said he can't process without the license and I want to make some actions with my own because I think he's not telling the truth and the company just want me to give some trouble. Now I am overstay here for 1 day and I will pay the fine even this is not my problem why I don't have yet the exit. How much fine per day?How expiration is calculated?Is it from the day I enter here in Doha or the date of expiry date in my visa even I am here for 4months only. Thanks ashraf!
Q152_R14_C3 Bad
mytony; Why would you pay the Fine? It's not your fault; It's the fault of the Company; Let them pay the fine...
Q152_R14_C4 Bad
They said if I will not pay the fine I will stay here for 2-3months to wait for the license first and I don't want to stay here for long under that company because in the end they will give problems again.

Hi. I need help. I am applying for a nurse license in SCH and everything was okay. until I received my evaluation result which is rejected and the comment is 4 mos training. I want to get that training so that I can apply for re-evaluation and hoping I can get a license after that. Do I need to have certification in SCH that I am in training for 4 mos? Can my employer provide that training for me? what should I do? thanks for the help!

Please let me know whether you have residence permit. If you have residence permit then they will give you license as trainee so tat you can work in any clinic as tainee. Clinics will be happy to employ you because usualy they dont need to pay you if you are a trainee.

Q152_R66_C1 Good
is confusing. 1) You say you are ready to go back home and change visa to husband sponsorship. Do you already have a work visa here? or are you here on a visit visa ??? 2) he is a safety coordinator in what company ??? if it is qatar gas; qatar petroleum etc; the HR there can arrange for the family visa in spite of the profession problems. 3) if you are here on a visit visa and want to come back on husband sponsorship; then he / his company has to submit all relevant documents to the government and get his profession changed on the visa (this is on the sole desecration of the employer as he might not have a visa which suits his job)

thats what i thought. so as far as i understand; you are currently here on a family visit visa and want to convert to RP. your husband needs to get his degree certificates (the higher the better) attested in the home country and in Qatar as well. his company will then have to apply for a change in his profession along with his certificates and employment contract and other details. thought it cannot be guaranteed; sometimes the process can go fast.

Yep. HEAPS of places. You can go to Oasis though; they always let single men in. Which is why there are absolutely no women in there; but its a fun night anyway.

Ok...you have 2 options; Option 1 - West Bay - This is where all the towers are; and therefore most of the decent bars and restaurants. Depending on your job; you may well be based there as well. Regardless; the rest of Doha is within easy reach. Plus; you have City Center Mall for shopping. Option 2 - The Pearl - Set away from the main parts of the city; it's the main new residential development and is one of the nicest places to live if you like to walk around and live by the water. That said; they've taken away the alcohol licenses from the restaurants; so a lot of the life has disappeared. I'd favour West Bay personally. YES; you do pay more money to live in these 2 areas; but then again; you pay more to live in the nice areas in ANY city. Oh; and give up any thoughts of finding somewhere similar to any neighborhoods in major cities! It's not possible... Good luck!

Who's the best DJ;newsreader;and announcer on QBS??"
Q153_R40_C1 Good
The lady who does the rock show in the afternoon / evening is pretty good. Hate to say it but its hardly a race of champions! Can someone please convince Bernie that it may be best to retire though... I feel really bad writing it; its like telling an Uncle who is embarrasing not to get up and dance at a wedding. Anyway; I digress.. Newsreaders are always good for comedy value; although most of the time unintentional. Go QBS!
Q153_R40_C2 Good
I hope I got the name right. She is a good RJ for Qatar. Or maybe her slot-Rock Music is good. And ofcourse Bernie.He knows to engage the listeners. People should know the difference between an RJ and a DJ. An RJ's requisites are much different than those of a DJ. RJ- Talk 19 to the dozen. Know his/her music.Engage listeners with with humour/general knowledge/creativity. DJ- scratch the discs. Need not speak a damn word. No arguments on the fact that both DJs and RJs are excellent; extremely talented people in their own right. But when a DJ tries to be an RJ (as is the case with a few in QBS); it becomes sad. RJing has a long way to go in Qatar. Lots to learn from FMs in UAE first. Then aim at reaching global standards. Any comments?
Q153_R40_C3 Good
This has been discussed plenty. They are all terrible (although I think Jay has potential). Bernie Lyons is the worst DJ/RJ in the world. By the way mark DJ; through usage; is a perfectly correct way to refer to a person who plays music and talks on the radio. Bernie can't even read and he is a native English speaker. His music choice is abysmal. I think he is an embarrassment to the country of Qatar. Sums up the half baked way in which they tackle things; completely non commercial and out of touch.
Q153_R40_C4 Good
It seems that most of you who replied mostly listen to QBS in the morning .. THANKS;QATARKIWI :) !! Rana is indeed a great DJ and RJ..

Q153_R40_C8 Good
"I am sorry but only businessman here seems to have a hold on reality. QBS is universally crap. Bernie does not engage with anyone. In the Businessman's words; he is excreable. Elias is nearly as bad. He is boring disorganized and miserable. ""Rana is indeed a great DJ"" You got to be kidding! Her English is awful and she talks through most of the records and babbles a load of crap from Hollywood celeb press releases. Dire. As for JoJo. Words fail me. The newsreaders are pathetic especially the Englishwoman Amanda Wright. She has no excuse as English is her native language. The news itself is really poor - just a bunch of press releases and newswire stories cobbled together. The only tolerable DJ is Dan Harper and Jo Mitri tries; at least he is not offensive."
Q153_R40_C9 Bad
They all suck.
Q153_R40_C10 Bad
I was trying my best to be positive given the QBS situation. Disc Jockey is not = Radio Jockey In Europe ; there is a distinct course / graduation stream for Radio Jockying.And capabalities of DJing is NOT required at all. and it DJing a separate optional course. Anyway; QBS will start being a better radio station if the formats change; have better RJs and not DJs. In most of the popular stations DJs are guest artistes. This gives rise to an important question on opportunity. Is there a scope for other FM stations in Qatar? Targeting expats ? If so; what are the suggestions? There is obviously a need for an INDIAN FM channel. What about others?

Skype is THE ONLY reasonable way to communicate with people back home out here. If they block it there will be a revolt. BTW; I strongly recommend buying some skype credit. It costs as much to call someone anywhere int he world using skype as a normal local call (might even be cheaper depending on your plan). Cutting the internet out of the equation anywhere along the line will improve reception greatly.

Qtel fixed the problem on their side finally a couple of days back.
Q154_R62_C10 Good
I had the same problem and logged it with QTEL. I then ended up speaking to a succession of guys who wanted to check my modem. What was really odd was SMTP connections to port 25 were blocked from outside Qatar but not within the country. As things were somewhat critical I redirected my MX record to a server outside Qatar and got that server to deliver mail to a different port (200) on my gateway. To be honest; its a better solution anyway than getting remote nodes delivering to a dynamic DNS host in Doha. I've written up the configuration for postfix in my blog. If anyone has problems implementing it feel free to drop me a line. http://ams1.x31.com/~andy/2010/01/when-your-isp-blocks-incoming-smtp-connections/ Andy

Q155_R31_C1 Good
You don't need sea salts. Any salt will act as a disinfectant. Boil some water; pour normal table salt into the water; let it cool to a bearable temperature; and then soak for as long as you can be bothered to hold it. You may want to put the piercing back in as soon as you can if you don't want it to close up. Btw hi!

I think it would be better for you (for your peace of mind) to consult a doctor for your infection problem. Doctors know what is best for you; at least they are trained to do so.

The first time I got my ears pierced; one lobe became infected. The doctor told me to use 'hydrogen peroxide'. Apply by soaking a cotton ball or qtip and use it liberally thru-out the day/night. It took about a week;before going back to normal.
Q155_R31_C6 Good
I agree with above. Get hydrogen peroxide and wipe the infected area with this on cotton swipe/soak several times per day. You can get the hydrogen in most supermarkets & pharmacies. QR 6.- for a bottle. Improvement should be within 24 hrs.

You basically have to get a partner-ship with a local. Bad move because that is just telling me you have no rights and you are piggy backing with someone's sponsorship. The best information is to ask a realtor locally. Just write your questions in a piece of paper. Unless they have designated zones designated for foreigners only.. resorts or islands stuff like that. For my perception of this place is their greediness is their driving force for all the rentals pricing. I live in a compound that my company leases out and I could tell you the structures are 15 years old and its falling apart; slowly but surely.

In my opinion the most effective is AVG. Some people don't like it; as it is system intensive (meaning it slows your computer down while the scan is running); however in terms of the most up to date virus protection; and a very thorough daily computer check; it is one of the better ones.
Q157_R3_C2 Good

Q157_R3_C8 Good
All the antivirus software’s are the same they all scan and delete Viruses; Trojans; and Worms etc. The important thing is knowing how to scan a pc! Viruses mostly uses startup programs to infect a computer therefore before performing full computer scan using any antivirus user should make sure that he/she logged in using safe mode. While in a safe mode user has to start the antivirus software manually then perform full scan. Safe mode kills all the unnecessary programs and allows only drivers any programs which need to run the OS as a result while scanning for viruses in safe mode your antivirus will normally scan more files and has more access to any programs loaded to your HDD. Kaspersky is still most reliable antivirus software.

Its depends. How severely your computer has been infected? Try to remove first by Trojan Remover V6.7. Probably your anti-virus will wont work. After you slightly remove by TRv6.7 try installing Kaspersky. It is the best in the market now. Unless you need a clean format to your PC.

Johnson's baby products are all synthetic.

Having briefly mentioned this; how safe they can be? On healthy babies they won't have immediate side effects; but on long term they will to the point that you won't have any clue it's them to blame. There are dozens of organic products these days. Why you have to wonder about Johnson's any longer?

In an un prejudiced society there would be no problems at all but unfortunitely a world of problems could occur. You would face all sorts of name calling etc; your children could suffer also from being mixed race. However; mixed race marriages are becoming more tolerated and if it what your heart is telling you then no amount of small minded insults should stand in your way; you just need to be strong and have the courage of your convictions :)

I see a lot of people have already written a reasonable answer; but keep in mind following: - about flat or car rental - depends who negotiates. If a European person or a westerner in general - forget it to find those rates. For them everything is double. - as many have mentioned - depends on lifestyle. For example one of the most difficult issues for women here - to find a normal hairdresser; beautician; etc. usually too expensive and very low quality / level of hygiene. If you go to a normal place - prices are ridiculous for what you get.

Wow; that is alot of money. Depending on where you stay as cost of renting an apartment varies on location and type. IF you get a room; sometimes it costs 2000~4000 for villa around old airport area. Those slightly better conditioned apartment flat like 2 bedroom ones maybe around 7500~13000 like holidayvilla service apartment. Water and Electric bill probably around 300 or less. Phone bill local is cheap+internet if you get a package maybe less than 500 per month (this includes the special TV package) If you can secure an accomodation like now in some hotel cum apartments you might get a good deal for a period of a year rental as this is when less people visit Qatar. Next is your transport. Assume you rent a car (think about buying later on); on average a decent car probably cost from 1600 to 2000.

Are they giving you money to furnish your home? You might as well pocket that money and use it towards getting furnished apartment - which for a 2 bedroom is about QR8;000 - If you are only earning QR13;500; your salary diminishes drastically and you are only left with QR5;500 for a Car; monthly utilities; groceries; school fees and entertainment.... and if you are only getting QR1000 for your airticket home; then you are going to need to save for the rest of your ticket and that of your wife and child.

Am I the only one who seems to experience a problem with taxis that don't slow down to pick you up; when quite obviously you are waiting for their service? It has happened to me a number of times where about 2 or 3 taxis bypass me; even after I have waved them down. It makes no sense. Why on earth would they just keep driving? Surely they are contractually bound to pick up fares if they are on duty? Is anyone else finding the same thing X

do not get me started with them. Even after all this; more and more taxis they do not seem to improve. I have called in the past outside Rydges around midnite; there were maybe 30 Karwas waiting outside but I called to order for a taxi from QBC (Qatar Bowling Centre); maybe 200 metres away and they told me they had no taxis for 1 hour. I then went into and told them a little about themselves and their incompetency. I have had the experience sooooooooooo many times like you. If only they stopped they'd know that I was going exactly the direction their going!!! I have no idea what is going on there but its sheer incompetency. Do they know if their hiring?

Q159_R41_C7 Good
If you want to save USD4;000 (QR15;000) from a salary of 40;000 that means you can spend only QR25;000/month. If you take away 12;000 for rent and 8;000 average for schools then the remaining is QR5;000 only to spend every month. If you want to live decently in a compound with kids going to ASD; then QR5;000/month is definitely not enough to cover all other expenses including phone;internet; power; water; groceries; clothes; eating out; gifts; other kids expenses; a maid (is almost a must for a working lady wtih two school kids); travel (once or twice a year); transportaion. The other question you can ask yourself is weather your job really deserves a payment of more than QR40;000/month or not. We are a family of 4 living in a compound villa and have 2 school kids and our average monthly spending is in excess of QR40;000/month
Q159_R41_C8 Good
your fixed expenses per month would be Housing - 12000 (although if you look hard; you will get a 4 bedroom villa for 10K) School fees - 7500 Phone/ Internet - 1000 (depending on your usage) Adding up roughly it still gives you a balance of 19500 (40000-20500); which is approx $5300 So you have around $1000+ for your other expenses such as groceries; eating out; shopping; etc. It's just a question of how flexible you are with the amount of $4000 that you wanna save; or should I say on the amount you wanna spend on miscellaneous stuff.
Q159_R41_C9 Bad
Thank you everyone. This has been helpful. I was reviewing some other sites as well and I think I could likely save by living in a smaller home and hence paying less rent; but overall it seems that this may be doable.
Q159_R41_C10 Good
Be aware that although there is a lot of affordable housing choices right now; it's only happened in the past 18 - 24 months. Should demand increase(unlikely right now IMHO) you may find housing costs taking more and more of your salary. As Mandilular said; many employers here pay for both schooling and housing. Another issue might be finding a place for your children at the school of your choice. The better schools have long waiting lists (often a year or more) - get them on a list ASAP as soon as you make your decision.

My husband and I love being at home; we prefer high rises with a nice gym though given we are bringing motorcycles over I am thinking somthingh is a garage might be best. We have no kids so schools and having other kids around us is not a top priority. Given this; which areas/buildings would you guys recommend? We don't want to commute more than say 30-40 minutes each way if we can help it (to and from new DOHA airport). What information is there out there about the Pearl; I imagine is still is mostly a huge construction site but are there finished buildigns there worth commuting to and from?

Q160_R28_C4 Bad
"Qatar's property development websites are misleading as most of Qatar itself. What you see is not what you'll get. Lusail is a ""planned new city"" due to open soon but you go there now; all you'll se is an empty desert land with maybe 2 tower cranes. Pearl is nearly completed but with a lot of infrastructure and other nature problems. Both locations are at the north outskirts limits of the city; while the new airport is being built at the southern outskirt limit of the city. You do have to across the whole city and the traffic here is another nightmare (not only the traffic jams but also the aggressive and risk driving local style). If no traffic; it will be a 20-30 minutes drive. The best location for you would be near by the Marriott Hotel. A friendly advice: be prepared for the biggest frustrations you ever experienced at professional and social levels and you won't be disappointed. I wish you all the best!"

Anyhow; in Dubai a few years ago; I imported some choppers from the guys off Discovery Channel program. The Duty was 5% of the CIF Value. (eg. Bike is US $20000 CIF then Duty will be US $1000) I then had to pay a local agent commission on the import of US $1500 each as they held the import licence agreements for the bikes. Therafter; Police Inspection; Registration and other details were approx. $1200 per bike. Then of course you will have standard insurance and road tax; which I believe is approx. $100 per month in Doha.

My husband is a life-long motorcycle junkie. Got his first when he was about 10 years old. He would never consider riding one here in Doha. Traffic is very dangerous. They have the highest accident rate per capita in the entire world. Check out some you-tube videos showing all the spectacular car crashes in Doha. You have to see it to believe it. Seriously most people see a car crash every single day. Riding motorcycles on the streets in Doha is only for fools in my opinion.

Hellooooo; buterflyyyyyy hereeeeee! When are you coming to Doha? Right now you get a windy day every now and again; but it the warmer months windsurfing is imposible. I haven't done any windsurfing in Qatar; only in the atlantic coast of spain; so I don't really know how fast you can go here. Waters are very shallow. I think around Mersaieed is ok; wind-wise; and the sealine resort rents equipment (i think; don't take my word for it) I haven't seen any shop that sells equipment; but I haven't done any research either. There must be at least one somewhere.
Q160_R33_C3 Good
Hi I'm into windsurfing and do a fair bit here. The conditions can be excellent but unfortunately windy days are few and far between. However; in the summer the shamal wind blows and it makes for fantastic conditions. The shallow water is excellent as it is warm and easy to rest if you need a break. The most popular places to windsurf are near the intercon hotel. Messaieed is not a great place at all. I would suggest that you consider taking up kitesurfing if you want to get out on the water. It is easy to learn if you are a windsurfer and you can get planing in much lighter winds. I started last year and enjoy it a lot. There is quite a big kitesurfing community here and equipment is cheap to buy. If you want info on where to buy it let me know. See you out on the water
Q160_R33_C4 Bad
Thanks Butterfly and Super7. My family will come to Doha somewhere in the beginning of March. My wife learned how to windsurf a few summers ago and i have been hooked to the sport for over 20 years now. I used to compete in all kinds of events in various disciplines in many places over the world; (also Tarifa Butterfly..). The past few years i have not been able to go out on the water much; but i hope that will change again in Doha. For some strange reason i can not switch to kite surfing. Windsurfing is the sport i love. Even my friends who have switched; go out on windsurf gear when it gets windy and waves build. I very much hope to see you out on the water soon!

"Well AJ; this supports what u said: ""Monogamy is so rare in the animal world that only 3-5 % of the mammals are known to form lifelong pair bonds; like beavers; otters; jackals; foxes; some bats and a few dwarf deer and antelopes. In fact; strict monogamy is almost inexistent; as creatures that do pair for life; occasionally have flings on the side and some; like the wolf; do not mourn too much a death or a no longer sexually performing partner."" http://news.softpedia.com/news/Monogamy-is-an-Oddity-42006.shtml But we aren't like other animals; we don't function solely on sexual or biological desires.

I'm not trying to judge or know every single relationship's reasons for straying. I'm simply examining the phenomena of monogamy and whether it exists in humans or not.

OK I think the reference that Khaild has attached above is incorrect and misleading; people like MissX will have every reason to question the age of Aisha. All I know and from what I have learnt from this issue; which has been around for hundred of years is that she was of age of menstruation at the time of consummation. So lets just leave it there. Again I request Khalid the tiger to stop posting any controversial topic; or information that may create controversy. The biggest enemy is the lack of knowledge.. ----------------- HE WHO DARES WINS
Q162_R39_C9 Good
yes ; he did;but in Islam if the girl had a period already ; she has become a women ;also if the boys have grown hair they are man in Islam. I think you should not talk about things you have no understanding for!! Because at this point ; no matter what anybody is telling you ; you will reject it ; because you simply don't believe in Allah and that He knows that; which we don't know out of His wisdom! And that everything is decreed for a reason!
Q162_R39_C10 Bad
My intention is not to insult muslims. I respect all religions. The question: Is marrying is the only way to spread the religion and honor the people of a nation (Based on the presentation). Why can't the prophet get some followers (Like Jesus did) and teach them and ask them to spread the religion? or do some charity work for that nation and honor them?

Google Earth says that Suhaim Bin Hammad Street is right on Ramada junction? In that case; with Salwa Road on your left and Ramada Hotel behind you; go past Chilli's; and past Coffee Cottage (both on your left). Do a u-turn at the next signal and come back up towards Ramada signal. Take the side road at Hardee's on the right; and you are in Al Mirqab Al Jadeed Street. Turkey Central is on the right hand side; about half way up the street. It looks crappy but the food is excellent. If you are walking; it's even easier.

Engine size is same for a 2.5L; V4 and 3.5L; V6. Nissan's AC is more effective...but the parts availability is an issue....Honda's AC is not that effective in Gulf Region....Altima is more sporty... Accord is more decent and elegant.... Now the choice is Yours....best of luck.

If you have an active social life and always want to hang-out with friends; choose Honda. It's the car for people who loves to interact with different kinds of people.

Q164_R24
Why is polygamy/bigamy is considered a crime in the west? Crime in what sense? what if the wife agrees? And is cheating on wife/having a permanent girlfriend besides her considered an equally serious crime? and why? Why is polygamy/bigamy prohibited; while prostitution and same sex marriage are being legalized? It is said that even in Islamic countries; bigamy is limited; so why is the west so scared about it?
Q164_R24_C1 Good
economic issues (taxes and benefits); but don't know for sure. I think if everyone agrees and they can support themselves; they shouldn't be penalized. But I do think that children are made the unwitting partners in these situations and it can be very; very hard on them. They don't actually get to consent and the choice is made for them. I don't think the West is scared at all about polygamy. They simply don't approve of it in their societies. It's their right; isn't it? Please note: Prostitution is not legalized in the US (except in one strange county in Nevada that I have never understood) nor is same sex marriage; except in a very few cases.

Q164_R24_C9 Good
it's not only in the west but also on some countries in the east that polygamy/ bigamy is outlawed. the reason is simple; it is illegal in the new testament (bible). i'm not sure what's the reason for buddhist countries like thailand & singapore to adopt monogamy though. for muslim countries like malaysia and indonesia; it is common for muslims there to marry only one. cultural convention; maybe.. in my country; adultery/ concubinage is a serious crime. but it is a crime that is so hard to find evidence of:-) usapa na...
Q164_R24_C10 Good
Polygamy is not a crime; you just can not be married to multiple individuals which has become a standard that derived from Judaism/Christian values. As time progressed and the consequences form multiple partners slowly revealed itself; std's HIV and such; we can conclude that this has been the right approach. Unfortunately the popularity of 'couples' clubs; where couples seek another couple for sexual purposes is becoming more and more popular. Prostitution in some countries is legal; some not. As goes for me governments should legalize prostitution and register all that practice; create labor unions and tax them over their income. Why? This cuts the throat of crime; represses human trafficking and serves a purpose in society. The same goes for soft-drugs.

Hi; I understand where you are coming from. Have the same fears myself. Especially with the speed; beeping of horns; not using indicators; very little road courtesy; people crossing without looking; children stunting on roads; drivers weaving in and out and roundabouts are nightmares to me here. Also coming from UK; the road directions here took some getting used to. I started out driving in my neighbourhood during daytime (when no one else is out). Next I set out the route I will be taking; the turns involved; what I should look out for and what I can expect to encounter on that drive. Then went on short runs to nearby shops during non busy traffic times. After that; did the big roundabouts and big roads during non traffic times. Still do most of my driving during lower traffic times actually as it is easier on my nerves and teeth. You can try that just to gain confidence in handling the car; roads and driving situation here. Good luck.

Are you crazy to call back an unknown number? Do you know someone to call from that country code? Have you heard about sim cloning? If they want to talk to you they will call again.

If you wish; i can give u in full details how to solve your problem.. Save your LAPTOP...

Yes dear Dell inspiron 1525 is very good. In Dell inspiron there are two configurations available in the market. So make sure which configuration is good for you. There is nothing in buying laptop that you should ask others. Just know little bit of basics and thats it you can buy a very good laptop by your self with out any help. Like some people said that buy from here or there and not from Dell or what ever. Actually you can see the configuration that you are interested and checks the price every where. Some times the dealer is selling cheaper then others and some times others are having a better offer. So best of luck. If you have any confusion on any configuration issues let me know. I am happy to help you. Regards

We have a 4-year old Acer Laptop with the following specs: Intel Celeron 2.0 GHz-M 256 MB DDR SDRAM 30GB Ultra ATA/100 HDD 8x DVD-ROM Only using it to check emails and hubby plays pc games...but sometimes memory runs low... can laptops be upgraded? does it cost a lot? or is it better to buy a new one? i believe there are a lot of QL experts here for advise...

if your only using it for checking email; that laptop is still good. but if your hubby are playing games..it will really make the memory low because all programs eat tons of memory..but it depends on the game.. anyway; back to the topic; i really advise to buy a new one because upgrading is not really advisable.. but that is only my opinion.

Yes you can upgrade the ram in your laptop. This day and age; 512mb is the minimum for a good experience. If you can afford it; I say buy a new laptop with at least 1gb ram and a good processor. You don't game or do any media editting so you don't need to worry about having a speedy processor or a great graphics card. Watch out though if you get vista. Although it's supposed to be better; I find that XP is much better. OR if you wanted a great all in one solution. Get a Macbook. You can install windows on Macs now :) __________________________ Cost of Living; Visas; Safety Info; Tips on Moving; Facts; Pictures; Videos; and more!

RAM upgrade is the cheapest way to go that if you only use it to check email and play game once in a wile.

People usually go out to buy new one cuz laptop space are limited and it's just too difficult to upgrade.

I went to Japan Technology; or Japan Computers; or some name like this and they fixed in few hours and very cheap price; be sure to barter the price down though. Although all shops in computer souk will fix this problem for you if they have the same keys from their spare parts available; just shop around until someone helps you; just putting back/replacing keys should be v. cheap. I also got new lcd screen fitted after my son broke it by closing a book inside; not as pricey as I thought was going to be. Go down Musheireb Street; shops are next door to Mercure Hotel in their own building; Japan up one flight of stairs at the back in the corner. Best to park behind hotel as space limited on Man Road.

Locals in Qatar are the least friendly and approachable of all people. They do tend to keep to themselves and they rarely allow outsiders to become their friends. This is sad as foreigners tend to stereotype a lot because of that; but how could we possibly know any better?

Q167_R41_C7 PotentiallyUseful
E46M3; I am glad to hear that. However; I believe it's different with guys :^) As the society is so strictly segregated; men in Qatar are totally different from the ladies. I could probably make friends with local men but that would not be appropriate as this country and culture does not allow such friendships. Therefore I was referring to girls only. :^)
Q167_R41_C8 Good
I think they are very well mannered people who have the right to brag about great hospitality. But I agree that they keep to themselves a little more. I guess its the language that might keep the locals off; Ive met many who are not really confident speaking English; even though they speak it pretty well.
Q167_R41_C9 Good
"that's my experience; too. I guess it's more of the culture; where it's more difficult for the ladies to widen their social circles. But overall the qataris I have met; both men and women were all lovely gracious people. That said; however; one of my pet peeves here are how ""some"" ladies in Abayas have no respect for queues. Twice i've had an abaya wearing lady step right in front of me in a queue. The thing is; what made it worse was; both those times the queues were not long. In fact there were 3 people max. I mean; how long am i going to take paying for 1 t-shirt? Another time; i was in the ladies room at the movies and waiting patiently in front of of the stalls and again; another abaya lady steps right in as soon as the door opened and the person inside came out! I guess next time i shouldn't step away to give the person coming out room and just barge in just in case another person takes my stall! THe thing is the people I met are just so nice; yet some strangers i came across are....."

Agree with Jassim on couple of points.. Locals keep to themselves and never bother expats much.. Locals are not arrogant (Most of them..).. Disagree on UAE nationals... UAE nationals are not arrogant either...Dubai is built mainly because of the attitudes of the locals..Ignorant and under-educated crowd is arrogant everywhere and shall be discounted....

Ok... I wanted to start a topic i know will stir up some emotion because theirs nothing like a good old heated debate. Its mainly for the men here (but you lovely ladies are more than welcome (as if i could stop you anyway)). What is a womans role in society?

Q167_R75_C3 Good
I donÂ´t think there is an ideal role for women today; but the good thing is that in most societies women have the choice to do whatever they feel fulfilled with. Be it career; housemaker; raising children or just being a funloving girl; is it not just great to do it just because we choose to and not because it is what society/family/partner expects from us? As being equal in terms of house chores... Well; I guess every couple is different. When I was working; my husband used to do his fair share of the cleaning; even thought he also had to work long hours. It is only when I had to stop working (my choice) to raise my baby that I do the cleaning; laundry etc; just because it is only fair. So I will say; Equal partner. And if your g/f is the one who does the laundry; make sure that this is a situation she is happy with.
Q167_R75_C4 Bad
I think the fact that my sports socks give off a green gas and melt the laundry basket is her biggest concern :)

I think you need a minimum salary of Qr. 7000/- if I am not mistaken to get visa for your family. I have no idea about your salary package. Are you getting family accommodation from the School over your monthly salary? Accommodation is the most expensive thing in Qatar. You should also consider other expenses like food; school; medicine; transportation; water and electricity plus communication. You should also consider the air fare which is quite big if you are going every year to your country. You should give us an idea what will be the package you are getting to advise you.

I think it will be tough even at a well paying school. I know plenty of single teacher friends at some of the best schools here and can't imagine them supporting three dependents on their salary.

Q169_R71_C10 Bad
Thanks so much everybody for your answers. I know it will be tight; but its getting pretty tight back in blighty right now so I'm considering a sunnier option. The school is offering accommodation; tax free salary and some other perks i'm as yet unsure of. I wouldn't consider it without them. Until I posted the question I didn't know that the cost of living in Qatar was so high! So thanks for the info and keep it coming if you can.

It's rarely the case of matching job requirements; qualification and the package. A simple multiplication would lead you to over a Million QR per anum. Honestly; what do you think you have in return for that that many others with much less salaries do.

Q169_R87_C10 PotentiallyUseful
The base salary is relatively meaningless without considering perks and benefits.

I agree totally with Pathanamthitta; you will not be able to save much; but finally it depends on you kind of living specially the level of education you are asking for; as you will find an Indian Schools starts from QR 2;000 per annum and up to QR 10;000 for each child. anyway i think you should compare the offered salary and the average for same position.

If your payment is 23000 is it a year or per month because if it was per year no way. The fact that you have a family to feed can make it harder because of the house needs to be a little bigger and food bills can cost.

Hello curiousbutdetermined; Well I have some experience. But science does not pay that much anyway where ever you go in the academia. So I was not sure; if I have to leave working in Europe; and come to Qatar but still be paid as I would be back home!!Is it true that even an American university in Doha would still pay as it would back in the U.S? Obviously apart from the housing and car allowances. Plus; I thought they would provide relocation expenses; but they did not mention it to me.. thanks anyway for the input

Q170_R33_C6 Good
QU will pay much less than an assistant professor in engineering at Texas A&M. Both will offer a good package in terms of housing; tuition for children and transportation; medical; etc. The 60% increase is for Qataris; not expats; in government positions. QU isn't considered gov't. I would guess that QU might offer an ass't prof 20-30;000 QR to start. Sorry; they do tend to low-ball. Mandi

Thanks Mandi. Thats really helpful.
Q170_R33_C8 Good
Actually; expatriate faculty at QU are getting the increase. (I don't know why; but I won't complain about a salary hike.) I don't know where that puts it in comparison with Education City; but people at QU are pretty happy about it. Base salary for a new Assistant Professor of Engineering at QU would probably be in the range of 35;000QAR - 40;000 QAR right now; possibly more if the candidate is extremely well qualified.
Q170_R33_C9 Good
I take it back. 10 minutes ago we just got an email saying that it was an accident and that the 60% raise will not apply to non-Qataris afterall. So; expect 20;000-30;000 as Mandi said. It was too good to be true....

you want to view CABLE or DISH then buy PLASMA as in LCD the picture becomes little bit blur or shows small boxes if you got my point. Otherwise; if you want to play VIDEO GAMES or MOVIES then LCD will be very fine. I suffered at LULU Hypermarket when a salesman sold me LCD without asking me whether you want to watch CABLE/DISH or MOVIES. So first i had to buy LCD and then discussing the problem with him i again had to buy PLASMA which is awesome. SAMSUNG has very shiny & slick body which i dont think any other brand has it. . Rest is upto u **** Fool me once; shame on u.Fool me twice; shame on me!^^
Q171_R13_C6 Bad
Yes 3 year on the front panel and 2 years on the other parts..All othermakes just give one year warranty and that's Mr-me..

It seems Indians are too busy trying to be 'Western' they forget who they are!

Q172_R24_C2 Good
A particular group of people sagregating themselves is not same as racism. Indians overall are very kind people and refrain themselves from abusing anybody physically or mentally. Although; they may cheat you for money. Origin of racism is from stupidities like unnecessarily being rude to people; making foolish choices in business to favour a certain community wherein the candidate is less competant; not allowing people of a certain ethnicity not to enter a market wherein he could be a potential customer. Westerners are more racist than Arabs are. The only difference is they are not as foolish. And whatever else Indians are; but they are also not fools.

Dear Hassan; After the review status; it will show either postponed/rejected/under processing. If its under processing; defenitely this will approved in next two days after CID verification.

He took QR 20000/- from him for making it approved and now almost three months and no visa no money and no calls. Initially he told us just 3 days and now its three months.

there is a bit of a delay in processing family visas at MOI because the process moved from MOL to MOI. You're looking probably at around 2 weeks delay at the moment. Nothing to do with your visa :o)
Q173_R52_C7 Bad
So does this mean that the approval of Labour Ministry is not required on new family visas now? I am assuming that the MOL approves the application when you submit it and then you have to pay the fees to get your visa process started.

If your wife / husband under family sponsorship of your sponsor wants to work do they have to transfer the sponsorship to new sponsor or they can work without sponsorship change? What are the steps?
Q174_R13_C1 Good
No; they don't have to change sponsorship. They can work under family sponsorship.
Q174_R13_C2 Good
they can work ;only thing new employer needs ; will be NOC from husband/wife to allow to work
Q174_R13_C3 Good
Hi; If your spouse is under your sponsorship: meaning the visa indicated on his/her Qatar ID or Resident Permit is Family Visa; then there is no need for them to be sponsored by an employer unless you feel that there will be more benefits that you can get if your spouse will get to be sponsored by the company they got accepted at. But if your spouse's visa is just Family Visit; and they landed a job with another company and you cannot have him/her under family visa; you just have to submit a No Objection Letter to transfer the sponsorship.
Q174_R13_C4 Good
people under family visa can work without transferring visa but most of the companies now require the person to secure a labor card or a work perpim from the labor department if they would like to work. some companies required trasnfer of sponsorship.
Q174_R13_C5 Good
they don't have to transfer their sponsorship under the Company; unless they either want to or the Company requires their transfer. but; as Afifa indicated; they MUST obtain a Work permit from the relevant authorities in order to work in Qatar legally.
Q174_R13_C6 Bad
"How do you know if the spouse visa is ""Family visa"" or Family visit if it says ""VIS"" Okay the spouse can work without sponsorship transfer on the basis of no objection unless they choose or employer choose.

Q174_R47_C7 Good
Kinberly...husband sponsorship does not require NOC. You can transfer anytime; provided that your husband's basic salary does not fall below 7000. You need to apply this in the labor department (i don't know if process had changed); with your husband's NOC from company allowing him to sponsor you; degree certificate attested by DFA; Embassy and MOI; 6 months bank statement; Labour contract and company ID.
Q174_R47_C8 Good
very rarely private companies give an NOC . 5 in 100. now for example; if you look for a new job and then ask for an NOC; ur boss will say no it is not our policy and he will doubt at u and will remove u from the company and then choice but ban for 2 years. in my case i got the NOC first and then looked for a job. now u mentioned they do not have an idea then u should check in a very political way with ur boss if they give NOC. believe me go step by step. again i say check with ur boss first for an noc and then look for another job
Q174_R47_C9 PotentiallyUseful
Let me add one more thing...to change to ur husband sponsor the minimum requirement is QR 7000 as mentioned by coel and without this the labor will not approve it. for husband sponsorship u need NOC from current company

imtiaz...the only person required to produce NOC is the husband. Transfer of working to family visa DOES NOT require NOC. It's the same as sending your wife home and you apply for a resident visa under your name...no NOC required.

Certification attestation is required to prove the authenticity to apply for qatar employment visa. you need follow this process for attestation in india: 1) get it attested from Mantralaya and 2) get it attested from Qatar embassy in india. there are plenty of agents who can do this from india. if you do it personally it will 2-3 days max. i could tell you this because my husband did it for his degree.

Try the ASIA TRANSLATION service in sofitel hotel (Mercure). I got mine attested and returned from India in 10 working days. Cost is around 400 for each document you want attested. Mine was in a hurry as well. But they clearly mentioned there is NO way to hurry it up; even if u pay more. Very polite and decent people there. They will advice you on what to do; if you have a doubt regarding procedures. You better start acting now on it. As the more u delay the more time they will take in attesting + unpredictable holidays in India can pause the process. If u type in their name at the search option on top; u'l get the links to the exact adress and telephone number. Else just ask back in here and i will put it down. Another option is to dial 180 and ask them for the number. the BLUE pill or the RED pill ??
Q175_R23_C4 Bad
Oh and one more thing......Wen u get it thru these guys(ASIA TRANSLATION); they will help to get the seal of the Qatar embassy in India when it comes back as well. This is also required for getting the rest of the attestation when your document is back in Qatar. Wishing u all the best with the VISA thingeee. the BLUE pill or the RED pill ??

Q176_R19_C9 Good
This would be temporary as there is an oversupply of 2bhk/3bhk apts in the market. This is on account of the result of the Bid but once there are no takers at high rents; they would come down. The FIFA World Cup would take place in 2022. All stadium related development would take place only at a later stage. Other infrastructure development was anyways planned (although handover dates would be preponed). Premium villa’s (west bay lagoon area) might be a shortage and hence the rents might go up. Ultimately rents depend on the demand and supply of accommodation. Do not compare this to the Asian Games in 2006 – that was a different scenario. There was limited accommodation available and the apts that were available were of poor quality. Hence the rents shot up as people had no choice and there were takers at any price.

Could also be due to a large number of construction projects nearing completion and be a simple case of supply and demand nearing equilibirum????

Q176_R24_C8 PotentiallyUseful
Right now a lot of Qataris have taken loans with their old property on mortgage to invest in new Buildings. The Buildings which have been completed were expected to get higher rent than what is available today. Coincidently almost 90% of the construction in Qatar was aimed at 25% -30%% of the people ie Rich people. In almost All the companies only the Manager level people can afford such rents and most of such staff are only a handfull. Previously the Banks were easygoing on the payback of the loans. But due to economic slow and shortage of the available money they are trying to enforce payment. The panic has not really hit the Villa size buildings but believe me it will hit the Villa scene in about a year. The panic will be so great that people in the Construction Industry will not be given simple Vehicle Loans forget about personal loans. The Estate agents (middle men) are trying their best to hide their fears. Lets see how long they are going to put up their fake masks.

Q176_R64
Dear all; I am planning to settle in Doha with my husband as he has got a job there. He is a software professional with an MBA having around 18 years of experience. He has been offered a salary of 18;000. Is that good for his experience and sufficient for the two of us?

Q176_R64_C2 Good
Depends; If you are Western educated than the salary for 18 years experience with MBA is way too low. It should be in the range QAR 40000-45000 (including accomodation). A new villa in a compound will cost you QAR 12;500 upwards. Make sure that you move in a brand new place since quality of accomodation is pretty lousy. Note that Doha is a pretty dull place and does not offer the expat life available in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.

Q176_R64_C4 Good
I can see from your profile you are British. With an MBA and 18 years of experience; you can get better than 18.000. I personally think you should not accept less than 25-30 thousand riyals a month.

Q176_R64_C8 Good
British; MBA; 18 years of experience and 18000 that is too low. I don't recommend. to enjoy your stay at Qatar; you should get an apartment in a compound. You will never find any for less than 10;000 QAR. Cost living for two expats persons is minimum 4000 QAR. to Rent a good; not luxury; car you need at least 2000 QAR. The Insurance should be provided by the company. As I see at Qatar; British with 18 years of experience is getting around 50;000 QAR as a basic salary.

Q177_R12_C6 Good
Focusing more on the question in point; I can say that there are forms of expressing love that are religiously acceptable; while there are others that are not religiously acceptable. Among the forms of love that are religiously acceptable are those that include the love for Prophets and Messengers. It stands to reason that the love for Allah; and His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) should have the top priority over all other forms of love. Islam does recognize happy occasions that bring people closer to one another; and add spice to their lives. However; Islam goes against blindly imitating the West regarding a special occasion such as Valentine’s Day. Hence; commemorating that special day known as the Valentine’s Day is an innovation or bid`ah that has no religious backing. Every innovation of that kind is rejected; as far as Islam is concerned. Islam requires all Muslims to love one another all over the whole year; and reducing the whole year to a single day .....

Afterwards; the bank would need a standing order also stamped from certain authorities guaranteeing that you will be transferring the loan amount every month from your job salary in Qatar. After all that; you submit these documents to the bank for their approval. ( they will approve it if all documents are attested). Good luck :)

Q178_R50_C4 Good
when i worked with the semi-government company; my working day was 7 hours without lunch break; 7:30 to 2:30(you could have some snacks; coffee; tea; etc. during the day at the office); with 2 days off. Around 2:15-2:20 the ladies used to start gathering at the exit area; ready to leave; but still discussing whose wasta is stronger and whose abaya is more expensive...by 2:29 you could only see the trains of their abaya's.. :) Men were following them very soon; although trying to behave with dignity and not push each other at the exit. By 2:31 the office looked completely dead. Now; when I work for my hub's Company; I don't know my working hours; as I work as soon as I wake up until I fall asleep; I don't differ working days from weekends; I don't know what vacation is; as no 1 vacation day passes without opening both my Outlook and my Company folder in my comp; or answering business phone calls.. so here you go.. depends on who your boss is :):)

paulobanez: I was going to ask you the same thing. How much is a new OEM compressor for a Nissan Tilda? I have a similar problem with a 2004 Chevrolet Lumina and want to get the AC running like new. With fully charged AC gas and confirmation that there are no vacuum leaks; my AC runs acceptably in the evenings; but not so much during the heat of the day. This leads me to deduce that the problem is definitely the compressor; which is the heart of the AC system. I'm trying to decide if I should get the repairs done here while I'm still in the UAE; or wait until I arrive in Doha at the end of August. The price for the Chevrolet OEM compressor here in the UAE is 850QR/AED (there are other parts that may also be required when replacing the compressor; eg. something called a receiver [@180QR/AED]). If I can confirm that the price is similar in Doha; I will wait to have the work done there. paulobanez; if you happen to go to an auto parts shop to inquire about the price for a compressor for y.....

expats here tend to name roundabots and signals based on a visual description rather than the correct Arabic name for them. i presume this is because it's much easier to recall a location based on it's visual description. perhaps because many expats don't speak Arabic they find it difficult to remember or haven't read the signs. there is in fact an official Arabic name for each and every roundabout or signal intersection in Qatar!!!

and unfortunately; the beast is the unregulated market in Qatar. There are now MANY landlords who are refusing to pay any commission to agents; and this has therefore led almost EVERY main agency in Qatar to start charging tenants. In THEORY; they should provide you with a great; professional service; though admittedly this is not always the case. The UAE has a regulatory body in place....but tenants pay 5% there in fees for EVERY deal! Often the service is terrible there; even with the laws in place. As has been said; it's a one off payment.

Remember this rule of thumb: always occupy your legal spot. Vehicles exiting from the roundabout have the right of way; so not much of a problem unless you're on the wrong side. Position your vehicle towards your point of exit: left if you're going to the left or taking a u-turn; right if you're going to the right; and center if you're going straight. Now for small round-abouts- like the one at The Center- your signal light spells a big difference. Just signal your intention so that other vehicles can give way to you. Hope this was of help.

I had to go through this procedure last year because my company screwed up and didn't tell me until after I got here that they could not process my work visa because I needed a police clearance certificate. I contacted the Canadian Embassy in Kuwait. I was told that they don't have an RCMP attache on staff due to staff cuts and so the process would take 6 months. After much deliberation; I returned to Ottawa and got the certificate in 5 minutes (cost $25 CDN). I then had to get it attested through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and couriered to Doha. It then took them another 4 weeks to finally get me my work visa. Should you require additional information; you may want to contact the Chief Canadian Warden in Doha Linda Koych.

This is not a new process. It's been going on since then. Check their website for more info. Anyway; send the NBI clearance to your relatives who can help you out there in the Philippines. Let them go to DFA for the authentication. Enclose your letter of authorization also. The stamping can be done in the Qatar Embassy there. Just coordinate with Air21/Fedex to do that for you. The embassy does not allow personal appearance. Then; after the process; ask your relatives to send the document back to you. Got it?

I think for the first change in sponsorship one has to finish minimum 2 years of job; for second change onwards it is 1 year. You have to locate a new company; who are willing to take you on job under their sponsorship; get your Police clearance attested from the Ministry of Interiors (C ring road); then give the papers to PRO to fill the transfer form; get it stamped by immigration; authenticating the CR number; take it to your old company; they would do the same and return it back to you; hand over the papers with your ID card to the new company PRO and he would do the rest; after change a new id card would be issued and it is done!! if you are changing to a ovt job; you need medical done again and you need a police clearance from qatar Govt too (from Salwa road office after fort r/a)

In Islam we only worship Allah & we follow the Prophet in doing this so even our calendar is based on the Muslims first Hejra (departures from Makkah to Madinah ) cause this is a public concern for Muslims but whether the prophet is exist or not nothing will change so his birthday or else is not a holiday & if you really love him then do as he said follow him in the way he used to worship Allah the Almighty.

Seriously - would be great; once some of the others are back from their holidays; to get a trip going. Lots seemed interested including some of us ladies.

Why oh why there's limited visa for ladies here in Qatar. I've been to a lot of interviews yet there is no visa for ladies.

Q183_R1_C1 Good
I face same problem. I have been here 10months; great interviews; been offered great positions; from big compaines you would think can get female work visas; but nope. Right now must be on husband or fathers rp. I was told the quota for female visas are at quota; but wait until 2013. I even tried outside of Qatar; tried applying before i came here and get married. Didnt work. Same problem when i apply for AUE; or Dubai. Best wishes.

warning to some ladies out there. there are companies who will only assured you that they have female visa but then at the end of your current visa they will tell you we can't issue visa and goodbye. and worst is like what happened to my friend; she was hired then the company said that they are already processing her visa. but the one month tourist visa was over yet there's no visa yet. so she was asked to go out from the country and get another tourist visa because according to the boss it takes time to process the visa. but she was wondering so she tried to talk to the mandoob and found out that they have no female visa available. quite embarrassing.... they are taking advantage to some poor individuals.....

I was not allowed to sponsor my husband on family visa either. Luckily I was given married accomodation when I first arrived and refused single quarters. I could sponsor them for a visit visa but they could only stay here 6 months at a time; go back home for 3 months and then we started the process of visit visa again. After almost 3 years of going back and forth he finally got a job and subsequent his resident visa. Although the Labour law allows it if you meet certain criteria; HMC does not allow it.

While QatarLiving is a family-oriented site; Qatar itself is one of the most family-hostile countries in the world. The ratio of males to females (8 to 2) proves this clearly! (Statistical data from the Qatar Statistics Authority). And they are proud of this!
Q183_R29_C7 PotentiallyUseful
"LP ?? ""The ratio of males to females (8 to 2)"" ?? This Statistical data is probably 5-6 years old. Besides; it considers all laborers in qatar. If we take professionals only; I am afraid; the ratio today is other way around; 2 to 8 or close to it.. when last time did you go out? Drop by any decent night club and you will see what the latest real ratio in Qatar. On the New Year Eve I went to Crystal in W. I felt like in the discotheque somewhere at least in Barcelona. So many beautiful girls were around!! Some with the guys; some by themselves in the groups of 3-5-7! At some point I started regretting that i am not a lesbian.. As for the wife sponsorring her husband; it's not about HMC policy. Although there is a law that allows wife to sponsor her husband; each such transaction is processed by the authorities on case-to-case basis; involving consideration of different factors. And the main factor is a wife's Job designation."

Q184_R26_C9 Good
You csn go alone - esp if you have a little experience of driving on the sand. Most of the way to the inland sea from the Seaview resort is a well compacted; fairly level wide tract of land. Should be visible on Google Earth. When you get to the little roundabout in front of the resort go straight over; and head 45 degrees to the right and you will find it - then just head south. There are ALWAYS Qataris flying around who seem to take great pleasure in pulling incompetant foriegners out of the sand when they get stuck... its usually quicker to wait for a Qatari than it is to dig yourself out. remember the basic rules 1) Do not stop on flat ground esp at the base of a dune as the sand is very soft there. Stop on a slope so gravity can help you get going. 2) If you see somebody else who is stuck; dont park next to them - follow point 1 above; otherwise there will be 2 cars for the Qatari guys to pull out. 3) Dont slow down as you approach a dune - you need momentum. 4) Keep momentum at a.....

Q185_R58_C4 PotentiallyUseful
If I am back home in the States...I will not tolerate it at all; and have been known to hang the phone up when a sales associate is having a personal conversation while I am waiting to be rung up...or reporting them directly to the store manager. Here; I am a bit more tolerant since they don't get paid very much..but again; it depends upon how they are acting. If they are purposely being rude; then I will ask them to call the manager over and deal with it in front of the salesclerk. That usually gets results very quickly. If the clerk is just not smiling and going through the motions..I have to wonder if they are having a really bad day or are exhausted; and let it slide. Grant me the senility to forget the people I never liked;the good fortune to run into the ones I do;and the eyesight to tell the difference.

Q185_R58_C7 Good
It depends. If it's a souq store; for example; I walk away and won't buy anything. If it's a store big enough I complain pretty quickly. I work hard and don't want to give my money to a place that's not interested. If management does something about it; I buy. If not; I walk away.

Key phrases for complaint e-mails (taught by company to deal with underperforming suppliers/consultants) 1./ Always ask their name; sharpens the mind 2./ E-mail something like 'I'm saddened by your response to X' 3./ Next level is 'I'm saddened and disappointed by your response to X' 4./ Next up 'I'm saddened and disappointed; but not surprised by X' given what I've heard from colleagues'. C.c. in someone senior. Have had calls back from senior directors etc to the last one. Very entertaining. As far as shop assistants go - could not care less as long as I get what I want and quickly. Get irritated by poor restaurant service though. Always get the manager over and tell him why you're not leaving a tip...

Q185_R58_C10 PotentiallyUseful
Just asking because a sales clerk gave me a hard time for asking him to complete an order of mine he didn't finish (yes I was polite) and he started an argument with me (this was last week). I complained.. Went back to the store this week and the sales clerk saw me and came over to argue with me about filing a complaint. I complained again and told them I don't like shopping in a store where employees can be hostile towards customers. Got a call and the manager said he fired him. I didn't want to get the guy fired but I do want to shop in peace without some yob coming up to me waving his hands and raising his voice to me. Was trying to get a general idea of what others think is too much. Or if its a matter of my tolerance level being too low. ______________________________________________ Brazilian Jujitsu in Qatar http://iloveqatar.net/bjj/

3 things can be done ; 1) Ask him to write a letter in disagreement to the warning to explain his version of why he shouldnt be issued a Warning Letter. The Warning Letter still sustains as 1st warning and is filed into his P-File. 2) Suspension ; The employee can be suspended from days to weeks; depending on HR policies. 3) Immediate termination ; If the warning is based on safety issues; and the employee refuses to acknowledge the issue; then termination can be in effect as a last resort.

You have got it mistaken. It is that husband and wife should not have the same blood line; that is they should not be brother and sister.
Q186_R40_C3 Good
Genetic deformities have nothing to do with blood group; purely the dna make up of the two individuals. Obviously the closer you are related; the closer your genetic make up will be and therefore the higher the chance of having a child with a genetic problem. If there has been a lot of intermarriage within the same family over many generations this increases the risk.
Q186_R40_C4 Good
No this should not be a problem.the problem arises if one partner has a negative group and the other positive.this is called Rh incompatibility.another rare condition called ABO incompatibility arises when mother is group O and the baby turns out to be any other group.both of u go to a laboratory and get your bld groups determined ifyou dont know that.all the best.....

Q186_R40_C7 Good
Yes - `Biness` is right - the problem that can arise from the incompatibility is that your baby could be jaundice at birth. If the mother and baby are discharged quickly after delivery; make sure to keep a close eye on your baby`s colour to confirm the baby doesn`t become jaundiced. If you have any doubt; have the baby checked as soon as possible to avoid any complications.
Q186_R40_C8 Good
no problem at all ; as long as u both have positive blood groups ; if one of u has negative then u have to consult a doctor before having babies to give required Anti D medication then u still can have babies .... Regards and best of luck. But to confirm it;please ask a medical doctor !
Q186_R40_C9 Good
It's not the blood group; it's the rhesus-factor that can cause a problem!
Q186_R40_C10 Good
When you're pregnant; it's important to know whether your blood is Rhesus positive (Rh+) or Rhesus negative (Rh-). This will be checked from the blood sample that you give at your first antenatal appointment. If you're Rh-; it's important to know whether your partner is Rh- too. If he isn't; there's the possibility that your baby will have a blood group which is incompatible with yours; and this can cause problems.

I would suggest that you boil the tap water and use for drinking or run the tap water through a filtration process system such as Aqua Guard or Brittanica. Agents are here in Doha who would give you a demonstration and I understand the system costs you around 2000riyals but you have the liberty to pay in installments. But I have seen the demonstration and you would see the difference what a tap water or mineral water (any brand) offers. The results are amazing and am sure that you would forget all this mineral water and opt for this system. Unfortunately I dont ahve th nos. of these filtration company agent personnel numbers. whenever I get it; I shall surely post it . cheers Bob.

No more to hurry for calling them at time you have water shortages. Besides; they are offering one(1) free standing Water Cooler dispenser for free upon your first time availment of buying 2 booklet water coupons. At a cost of QAR1100.00 for 200pcs 5-gallon bottles; it's worth more than a service and the pure healthy water. I just had availed of it two weeks ago; i have a new cooler dispenser now.

yes; Hukk is right; nestle is not good with their service. infact; i came to know that manhal and nestle belongs to the same group. manhal does the filling for nestle; no wonder why they have such lousy service. to answer Mr.Vengal; i dont agree that manhal is the best; if u r using a dispenser with their bottle; you will be surprised to see red color plastic pieces inside the water tank and at times it is visible in your glass too when you pour the water out from the faucet. thats coz the red caps what they use on their bottles are not spill proof; when u put the bottle upside down on your dispenser; the cap gets punctured and blows into pieces and it ends up in your water. i guess only rayyan and sabeel uses spill proof caps; and hence its safe.

I'm using Al Manhal and the water sodium is medium; and the taste is not bad. Once a week delivery though unless you call (they will delivery 1-2 more depending on how low your family is). Their prices are the same as taking an empty container to the market and dragging a full one back; but delivered to your door! My roommate also uses Wataniya; which for the first month is super service; multiple times a week. Then seems to not be so super. But that could be that they changed to one to two times a week delivery and my roommate never knew (he also puts them out too late when most of the service starts 6-8am). The differences between the two is Al Manhal sometimes delivers leaking overused bottles; and Wataniya's bottles almost 100% look brand new. Wataniya's taste isn't quite as good as Al Manhal's but still not bad at all.

Hi guys;I need your opinion about something;is there anybody here using water filter instead of buying drinking water from shop?is the tap water is safe to consume after using water filter?Thanks in advance :)
Q187_R11_C1 Good
Yes; am using a RO Water purification system close to a year and it works perfect and we feel of having a 100% purified drinking water. Need to change filter every six months. Water from tap is good to drink but due to pipeline and untidy water tanks in your apartment you might need to buy & install a Panasonic water purifier which i think is more enough to purify/fitler your tap water and start use that for drinking purposes. I have the two in my house; where I came in without knowing about Panasonic being installed as part of furnished stuff. It's better you avoid drinking botttled water; they are meant for immediate needs. Good Luck! I have an article about this; let me know your e-mail ID; so to e-mail you that stuff.

Q187_R11_C4 PotentiallyUseful
I understand; the bottled water which is meant for drinking is essentially desalinated through distillation and then processed with some mineral salts. Non-drinking water could be a mix of RO; distilled and recycled waste water. In this there could be chances of chemicals ( in very low concentations) which are meant to act as lubricants and anti-corrosion agents during reverse osmosis since these additives are not removed fully by the semi-permeable membrane. I don't know if consumption of these chemicals could be detrimental to health in the long run. Expert opinion is required.

Technically you're only allowed to bring liquid through in 100ml bottles; in a clear plastic bag. Medicines and baby supplies can be brought though but are supposed to be tested.

But of course; that is not clearly important to the staff in this country like other countries that care about good service; so just sayn; or wishful thinking that logically it should not go just anywhere on the item. I know in USA the vendors of the food items come into the stores to stock the shelves and label and arrange them for marketing; & bigger profits.... not the in-house staff.

Q188_R42_C7 Good
as accompanied baggage when I flew here from the US. Qatar Airways charged me $150 for him; same as the excess baggage rate. I'm not sure of IATA regulations for cats - if you're allowed to crate them together I'm sure it would end up cheaper than crating them separately; but it may not be as safe depending on their personalities.

Although there are thousands of cats here - they're not Loba's cats. Thank you Loba for being responsible enough to take on an animal and for being prepared to take them wherever you go. Unfortunately there are not enough people like you and too many take the easy option and give their pets away or abandon them on the streets when they move. The best way to get a quote is to call up the airline you will be flying and ask for their excess baggage rate. Then weigh your cats & crates and that should give you a rought estimate of the flight. :: A pet is for life and not just for Christmas :: www.qaws.org

Dear Friends; Can you please tell me how many Kgs are allowed in Qatar Airways. If you have any information from some of your friend who travelled recently in QA . Because i heared that from 40 Kgs they reduced to 35 Kgs. Kindly reply me.....

7kg maximum

40kg. if you have any doubt call them up. that should solve your problem

How do you say 40 kgs when the allowace for business class is 30 you get 10 kgs more than economy and 1st class get 20 kgs more over all that Handbaggage allowance for all airlines is 7 kgs irrespective of what class you fly however 10 kgs is acceptable MAX.
Q188_R50_C7 PotentiallyUseful
As mentioned above; it depends on your destination. Better check with your ticket agent (when buying the tkt) or with Qatar Airways. Once I bought a tkt online and it was mentioned as 20kg. Then I call Qatarairways and ask about the allowance; they said 40kg and I carried 40kg. NO questiones asked at the check-in counter.

Plus; being english; people would most expect you to have a classical arabic (neutral) accent. An arab talking to you would be very amused if you suddenly came out with azzayak ya sa3adat al basha :) Plus; the egyptian dialect mispronounces some letters so thats not good for a beginner. whatever you decide. i admire that youre doing what thousands of expats never do after decades here.

Q191_R56_C6 Bad
Super 7; Despite 800 years of paceful occupation; Spanish is very much a latin tongue so I find French or italian to be much more similar to Spanish. Arabic has very little in common with spanish. You see ;the Moorish occupation in Spain was really very paceful and the spaniards were not forced to adopt the language or religion. Of course given the cultural superiority of the arabs at the time; they introduced lots of new things in politics; art; agriculture etc. and the spanish borrowed the arabic terms (words). So many spanish words are actually arab such as Alcalde (politics) Algodon (textile; cotton) or Alfombra (carpet) The sounds of spanish might vaguely remind to arabic sounds. Other than that; they are two completely different languages.
Q191_R56_C7 Bad

On the Salwa Road; where Nissan is on your left side; go straight pass the flyover; 1st roundabout take the 2nd exit (12 o'clock); you will pass the Mercedes showroom; futher down you will see a Mitsubishi showroom; 2nd roundabout; take 12 o'clock again; and maintain on your right side; take either the 2nd or 3rd junction to the right; and the KIA showroom is nearing the end of that small road.
Q193_R32_C8 Good
go over the flyover; past the decoration R/A; continue straight after about 2 R/A you will find KIA motors on your right; if you miss it; not to worry; there is another KIA showroom after the next R/A..again on the right
Q193_R32_C9 Good
Check the Google Map; Please. If going down Al Muntazah from City Centre; this KIA dealer is 50 meters before Al Aziziyah Round about; on your right. and this Al Aziziya Roundabout is the junction of Sports City Street and Al Muntazah.

Q193_R38
I brought a new Nissan Sunny car. When the outside temperature reaches 45o temperature; A/C will not work; compressor trips. Otherwise it is working fine. When I went to Nissan garage they told “ yes it is right; when the temperature goes more than 45 it will not work this is not a fault” anybody else is facing the same problem? Is there any solution for this?
Q193_R38_C1 Good
You ask the Nissan dealer to change the compressor. Since your car is new i hope its in warranty period. New cars compressor will work above 45deg temperature. Do it immediately; otherwise they will say warranty period finish or blah blah. Even old cars compressor working above 45 deg temperature.
Q193_R38_C2 Good
Nissan is taking you for a ride. Cars destined for the Gulf are built for this heat . Take it back to them and tell them to change it; with a new one and not fix it. I have a nissan; and the AC works just fine at 52 deg; or whatever the max temp reaches.

Q193_R46_C8 Good
Either of the three are good cars...All three are equally reliable...the choice is yours... Camry 2007 is great looking and will re-sell at the highest price...BUT..you will have 100s around you in taxis and it handles like a sofa...Service is OK..but when you have 1000 locals with Land Cruisers in Queue..expect less than perfect delivery on promised times..... Altima is good looking too..but its been around for 3 years now..and cosmetic changes are shoddy....Best airconditioning ..Stable but soft ride...Good Handling..poor service at Doha... Honda don't get it...whenever cosmetic changes are made..the result is worse than the original..Accord 2005 was great looking and Honda degraded it in 2006..Best engine..Great performance..Dodgy handling...Below par Interiors...Best service in Doha... Confused?? Don't blame me...

I like it but Civic Exi 2000 doesn't have any saftey such as ABS; EBS; Airbags;...etc. But with all of that; it's nice car and strong but will not response as supposed to be due to miss of the saftey system. Don't know about the Accord not either about Camry. So; what do you think?

we just moved to doha six months back and faced the same dilemma.the service at the toyota showroom was pathetic. no one so much as smiled at us let alone talked to us. after waiting for half an hour we made our move to the nearest honda showroom. i have always liked accord(though never driven it) but yes its shape isnt that appealing. Staff was very cooperative and the price reasonable. next stop was the nissan showroom where the service was superb. The altima 2.5 had all the features offered with the camry and honda but the price was much less. rear parking sensors were offered free along with blue tooth. We bought it there and then. satisfied customers since!

1500 QAR will be good enough for a small sedan as Lancer or equivalent on about 4 year loan.

go with small cars link toyota corolla or nissan sunny or sentra; head to the show room; the sales pearson will explain to you the process of car loans and calculate for you the intrest.
Q193_R62_C3 Good
QR:1500 is enough for a a mid range vehicle; Normally bank loan you will not get 100 %; you have to pay 20% down payment to the showroom and the balance amount you will get from Bank. The procedure is simple; NOC letter from compnay + CR + Computer card + your QID + PP copy + Bank statement is enough to get loan from Bank. And your a/c type should be current a/c.. if its saving you can change to current a/c easly.

Most of the gyms that I have seen are mediocre by US standards. All of the hotels have fitness clubs. Ramada appears to have one of the larger ones. I go to the Diplomatic Club. It's ok. It's outside of town and a bit of a pain to get to in Doha traffic. All are a little pricey - US$1200 per year or so. But you get pool privileges; etc. Most appear to have Ladies Only times. If you prefer to work out in the morning; you'll have a tough time. I have not been able to locate a gym that opens before 7:00 AM.

Q195_R26
I have seen a job that i think I would be ideal for me on www.bayt.com. The employer's name is listed. I know a recruitment agency that works directly with the company that has listed the position. Now would I better off applying for the position myself OR would I be better off getting the recruitment agency to apply for the position for me?? Thanks
Q195_R26_C1 Good
It's a lot better if you can do it yourself.Apply for that position directly since you alresdy know the company that is recruiting.
Q195_R26_C2 Bad
I was thinking though that I only know the company by name and the recruitment companies have built a relationship up withe actual recruiters of the company and might be able to sell me better? That is their job after all??

Q195_R26_C4 Good
I would apply via agency and directly to the company. there's nothing preventing you from doing both - apply via agency first (they will probably ask you if you already applied through another agency or directly for this role - then you say NO (which is true :o)... and then apply directly to the company. Why? Because you have no guarantee that the recruitment agency actually presents your CV to the company. So to have best chances - go for both! good luck!
Q195_R26_C5 Good
just like how the recruiting agent gets a commission for every candidate being recruited through them; a small percentage goes to the HR under the table for recruiting the candidate through them..... The top management would be unaware.... so its a give and take.... which means; always a higher chance of getting selected through the agancy.
Q195_R26_C6 Good
I disagree with you Geo - I've worked in HR for many years; and worked in a recruitment agency here in Qatar as well.... no recruitment consultant submits all CVs to the company - I can tell you that :o) yes; I agree that more of a chance being hired via agency; but... to give yourself the best chance - apply through both!

don't ever trust and waste your money with online job site. This is from my personal experience.

Apply through both; nothing stopping you from doing it.

Both seems like the best option! Will give it to the recruitment company first and then give them a day or so to apply for me and then I will apply it myself. Thanks!

Are you qualified? Nationality? There may not be any vacancies for the job you want or far more qualified people getting interviews first. Qatarization issues in your chosen field?

Q195_R43_C4 Good
I have it on good source that QP receives about 10;000 on-line applications per month. Unfortunately; there are apparently not enough internal QP resources to adequately screen all on-line candidates; so your best chance is to know somebody within QP who can apply a little pressure to move your file to the forefront. If Mystica is willing to help you on this front; I would say go for it.

You can only send 3 applications online and the 4th will be invalid. They are giving 90 days; for them to process the application and truly they contacted the short listed one.

I have seen many well qualified job seekers not even considered for interviews at companies like QP and RASGAS while people with NO EXPEREINCE and hardly any qualification get into good posts there just because they know some on in the recruitment division. This is really unfair to those who spent years trying to build a great career and get a good position in some good company.
Q195_R43_C10 Good
Here's a tip; you should first read the job requirement and qualifications; then you should cater your resume/CV to what they're looking for. Most big companies don't really have real people going through those resumes/CV; they have a software that look for keywords. In short you shouldn't have just one set of resume and always follow-up on your applications don't wait for the company to contact you. Hope this helps. If anyone needs help on there resume/CV; I can always spare some time to look it over. JhunBug
Q196_R4
Hi everyone; Would Greately appreciate your views I am currently working in India. I got a offer from a local bank in qatar in december; but now they say that they are not getting the work visa and work visas stopped for Indians. Now they explore option of transferring an existing work visa issued to an Indian which is not used . Whether this Option will work ?. If not how long the ban on Indians will continue?. Regards Raaj
Q196_R4_C1 Good
i dont think there is a problem nowadays with visa. Most of the reputed companies (banks; oil companies) get them easily. But if u happen to know that there is a problem to this particular bank; then its possible to get back that indian visa u are talkin about. usually; the government issues certain number of visas to establishments. If they bring someone and finds that he is not good or he misbehaves with the officers; then they have the right to kick him out of country; in that case the company gets back that visa and can bring new staff from india...
Q196_R4_C2 Bad
Thanks SHAHEEM. This will help everyone i guess. Actually the sponsors mentioned last week that all their visa applications ( for indian) are rejected and thats why they want to explore to transfer to me a previously issued visa for an Indian which is no longer used now.

Can you please tell me why Keralites post ads in Qatar Living in the Malayali language if they are Indians as you so proudly claim them to be? They simply don't want others even from India to apply or get the job! I have noticed this of another nation who post ads and openly state only KABAYANS. Qatar Living should not allow such ads as it only creates divisions and dislike. Any person from any nationality should have the right to get a job if he meets the requirements.

QTel's adsl is very capable of providing a good range throughout your house..provided its kept in a proper location where the signal is not blocked by walls or any other objects that can interfere with the signal.

My DSL sucks too; and I was hoping that it wasn't just me. We are supposed to have the 1Mb connection in our place and it really doesn't seem like it. If i'm downloading anything at all; even if i'm only downloading at 20-30kb total; the connection to other computers in the house slows to a crawl. Unfortunately though; I firmly believe that there will never be a better alternative; at least not within the next 3-5 years. Qtel has all the resources in the world to build an infrastructure that's worth a damn; but they just won't. I'm glad all of our money is going to such good use.

Q198_R36_C10 Good
You have to order Vonage from the U.S. - and have it shipped there. Maybe Aramex could get it delivered here; but I wouldn't count on it. Basically you sign up for Vonage and they send you a small modem-esque box that's the size of a few pieces of sandwich bread. You plug your computer and your phone into it and - voila - you have a U.S. phone number where you can make and receive calls. The downsides are: (1) When the internet is slow then the calls are choppy (2) When Qtel tweaks the settings for VOIP then it's impossible to make calls (3) I have not been able to get it to work as a modem for my fax; but I could be doing something wrong (4) Pretty sure you need a U.S. credit card (5) The Vonage box runs on 110V; so you need to hook it up to a small transformer (6) You cannot forward it to your cell number. . .well; you might be able to; but you would incur US to Qatar cell phone charges; which would be punitive. The downsides are very small; though - having Vonage ROCKS. good luck!

I mean a Pit bull would be more dangerous then those three races. (Yes I know; any dog can be dangerous in the wrong hands; even a Yorkshire; though there would be little reason to fear him.).

Hi all; My first post; have been reading for a while! My husband and I are coming to Qatar as he has been offered a job and we are brining our dog with us. He is a large breed; and special restirctions are needed for us to bring him in. I wanted to check with others who have come from the UK; how your pet has adapted to life in Qatar? Are there areas they can run free? Are villas OK for them? Thanks in advance
Q199_R15_C1 Good
they will accommodate that`s no problem. I have a dog as well but you will not be able to let him run free in parks cause it`s not allowed. But if you will go somewhere far to a beach outside doha it wont be a problem and you can take him with you along the sea side but not free. They don`t have the same mentality like us and some of them are not allowed to touch them because of their religion but it`s ok they will just ignore you. Nobody will bother you as long as you keep it close to you. In the end of the day is better for the dog to be with you cause he is part of the family already so even if will be different for him here at least he will be with you. Cheers
Q199_R15_C2 Bad
Thanks Cristian; Great to know he can run free on some beaches...are these far to get to? Are the villas generally with a big garden as he does love to run about!
Q199_R15_C3 Good
The villa's don't tend to have very big gardens; more of a yard. But on the plus side; you can take them to the coast or desert 10 mins outside doha and run them off lead. Like Cristian said; most other nationalities aren't too keen on dogs; especially if they're not viasably restrained. One thing I would advise; is to maybe to come out for a few months without your dog and make sure that the job and lifestyle are right for you; because once you've got your dog here; getting him back into the UK is a pain ( 6 months quarenteen) as qatar isn't on the pet passport scheme unfortunately - there is talk; but it may be a long way off!! Any probs or questions feel free to drop me a line!! Dem.
Q199_R15_C4 PotentiallyUseful
Thanks Dem; Is that a pic of your dog? I have quite a large dog; so he def needs to run and if we can drive to these beaches that'd be great. Yes that is such a pain re brining him back and the quarantine; but we don't have anyone we can leave him with for so long here in the UK - which again is a pain. So; if we walk him anywhere else in Dpha he needs to be on the lead? In terms of the villas etc; I am guessing he will be inside most of the time; becuaee of the heat.
Q199_R15_C5 PotentiallyUseful
"I have a largish dog (25 kilos) - we go to the beach (early in the morning to avoid inconveniencing those who are not keen on dogs) and she runs off lead. However; she is good at coming when she is called - if your dog is not; start working on that now. There are usually large open (vacant lots) that you can also allow your dog to run off lead; IF there is no one else around. Contrary to popular belief; dogs are not haram (forbidden); but there are certain steps a muslim must take after touching a dog or if a dog touches something a person uses. You can read up on it online. There was an article today in the Peninsula newspaper about how animals are supposed to be treated in Islam. Basically; just treat everyone you meet (until you know better) as someone who is uncomfortable/afraid of dogs. IMHO it's common courtesy to give way to the people; Hey I love my dog but I won't let her run ""wild"". I wish more people with kids felt the same way LOL Signature line > ""You can't fix stupid"""
Q199_R15_C6 Bad
Thanks marycatherine; Is there only one or two beaches where they can run? He is very good and will come back to me so no probs. He is slightly bigger at 45 kgs...but he is my baby! Also what are the vacant lots? Are these just contained areas where this is nothing? Are there any groups that meet with dogs? It'd be great to meet some other dog lovers as well; and let him socialise. I would always be careful of others feelings towards dogs; as I know not everyone will love him.
Q199_R15_C7 Good
There are a lot of people here in qatar with dogs; and you sound like you've got him under control; so thats fine. You're bound to find people with dogs to socialise with.

"With villas; it really depends on the landlord I guess. I live in a small compound with my wife and two dogs (one's pretty large at 42kg and the other is a 3 month puppy) and our neighbors also have a dog. We usually take them out on walks behind the compound where there's a big empty lot. However; you can't really walk your dogs everywhere (ie Corniche). There's a beach in an area called Al Wakra (which is about a 10-15min drive from Doha) where my wife and I usually take our two dogs out for a run and swim on Friday mornings with another friend who also has a dog. You'll see quite a few dog owners out there on the beach with their pets and as long as your dog is well behaved it's all good. It's a pretty big public beach and not crowded at all so you're bound to find a huge ""vacant lot"" where you can do your own thing and not bother anyone."

You would not be allowed to take a dog to the mall; but there are plenty of places you can take them for a walk if you don't mind driving a little bit. You would also have to check with your landlord that you're allowed to keep a dog in your villa/apartment. Obviously a garden is ideal for a dog; but it is possible to keep one in an apartment block; as long as you're willing to take it out for walks everyday.

Q199_R38
We are looking at moving to Qatar; we have a cockapoo who needs regular clipping; is it easy to find dog groomers. Are dogs allowed on the beaches and are there many places to walk dogs in Doha? Thanks Anxious DOg Owner
Q199_R38_C1 Good
"there are 2 vets that offer the service. Doha Vets and Qatar Vet Centre Dog walking places are minimil. If you are going to be staying in a compound; you would be able to walk around there. Cornish is another option; but you get hassled by locals who will tell you that its not allowed; but there are no signs; so I generally ignore them and tell them that my dogs are not bothering them; and until there are signs I will keep walking my dogs there. The best place is from the Emiri Diwan side towards the new Islamic museum. Never in the direction of Sheraton; as there are many more people. There are a few beaches; but on weekends too many crowds. Walking through the streets you will be hassled by people driving by; barking at you; or asking how much you will sell your dog for; or generally just harrassing if you are a woman. Hope this helps.

There is a great groomer called Stephanie; sorry I don't have her number at the moment but will pm it to you when I get it. She is US trained and very professional. If you fancy a lovely walk; away from people; you can drive to Zikreet beach; perfect for dogs but about 45 min drive from Doha.

Q199_R38_C4 PotentiallyUseful
Seb1; I understand how you feel; but many Qatari people have dogs and often the big problem is that people are afraid more than offended by dogs. I brought my dog 3 years ago and; on balance am glad I did. It would have been hard for me to leave him. Both Vets have a good selection of food and accessories and have Western vets. There is also a huge network of animal lovers; keep in touch with people such as Xena and others from QAWS. Xena has helped me many; many times with dog queries! Xena; you're a star!
Q199_R38_C5 Bad
Many Qataris are afraid of dogs plus they believe the dog is unclean because of how it cleans itself with its tongue so they don't want to be touched by a dog. Out of respect its best not to take them where locals are getting their exercise; but a recent notice on this site said the beaches were making dogs die due to poison. Plus; I have known people if they let their dog stray too far from them the dogs get taken; so keep the dog on a leash unless you are on a far off beach. It would be nice if someone posted parks that allowed dogs so far I don't know of any.

My neighbors leave their dog tied up outside all day and it's apparently schizophrenic cuz it stares into the woods and barks at leaves.

Q200_R29_C10 Good
you have already developed the antibodies from being in contact with cats. When you suffer from Toxoplamosis you feel very mild symtoms that are easily mistaken for a reagular cold; and whilst there is no danger; it is extremely dangerous whilst pregnant. Best to check with your doctor. IF you already had the disease then you have developed the antibodies; which means that you will not get it again so you can keep your cat. THis can be seen in a blood test. However; once your baby arrives; best to keep your cat away from your baby.
