Most massages in Qatar are a waste of money. All they do is just rub some oil. No body does deep tissue massage here.

my masseuse is very good. calling her from to time for home service. currently in the philippines for a month vacation; i guess. =( she is the best in aromatherapy massage.
----------------------------------------
there is a massage center near mall roundabout in hilal opp. to woqood petrol station
----------------------------------------
Try Magic Touch in Abu Hamour (beside Abu Hamour Petrol Stn)it will just cost you 60QR per hour and I've seen a lot of Qataris as their customers.

Can anybody recommend a good place for head massages? I am constantly getting migranes and would like a head massage after the medication has done its job as I am left very drained. Thank you :)

Hi Roy; what place is the contact number for that you posted?
----------------------------------------
I dont know the name; you can call them. Do it fast; they have sooooo many reservations ;)
----------------------------------------
Roy; thanks; but is it a beauty salon or what? Do you at least know the location?
----------------------------------------
"The BEST MASSAGE in Doha ""VALUE FOR MONEY"" from my opinion is @ Merzam Residence;(cream color building with light blue glass window); opposite of The Center (Mega Mart)Bin Mahmood. Price is very reasonable; QR 150 for one hour. Therapist is from Bali island and he was working at Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Dubai. Phone no: 44274037. www.merzamhotels.com"
